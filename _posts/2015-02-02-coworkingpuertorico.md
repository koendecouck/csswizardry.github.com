I arrived at Piloto January 1st, 2015. It was a time of new beginnings. Today is February 1st, one month later. Here are my thoughts so far.

+ Beautiful modern aesthetics
+ Spacious
+ Plenty of natural lighting
+ Free coffee
+ Little terrace area where you can take calls while enjoying the Puerto Rican sun
+ Book lending service for startup and design books
+ Very international-minded with English support for everything
+ Enthusiastic, friendly founders (Very knowledgeable about Puerto Rican legislature!).
+ Central hub for startups and innovation in Puerto Rico (lots of events that are free to members).
+ Very close to legislature buildings (city hall)
+ Currently booming!

- 10 Mbps internet, with occasional hiccups.
- Closes after 7pm and in weekends
- Old San Juan is a very expensive area to live (comparable to Miami).

<strong>Location:</strong> Best place to work if you're based in Puerto Rico, although you'll find it challenging to find an affordable place to live nearby. Check out <a href="http://puertorico.en.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>, and <a href="http://www.clasificadosonline.com/">clasificadosonline.com</a> (a local, Spanish only site that is more popular than Craigslist). Prices are seasonal: high in January-April, low in May-December (hurricane season). Prices are highest in Old San Juan and only start to drop of once you get a significant drive away. Most people commute using their cars, but there are bus lines that are reasonably timely. Talk to some locals about a guy-who-knows-a-guy when looking around for a place to live (I found an unlisted room for $350/month, after haggling). Caribbean local culture is still very hands-on and personal. When you get out of the Metropolitan area, prices suddenly drop drastically (except for popular tourist zones like the beach line).

<strong>Overall:</strong> 
The modern feel of the building does wonders for your optimism and work ethic. You'll get to know the founders personally, and they'll be the first to ask how you're doing or whether there's anything you need.  A simple 'Goodmorning' already feels great when you come in for another workday. I loved the book lending service, which is very informally arranged. I picked a nice startup book to read before bed or take to the beach with me in the weekends. When I arrived I was a little concerned about there not being enough desk space, which turned out to be completely unjustified. Most space is first-come-first-served so start your day early to stake claim at the nicest desk. They're open 8am-7pm on weekdays. I just wish they had a 24hour 7 day policy, but Puerto Ricans do take their weekends seriously.
