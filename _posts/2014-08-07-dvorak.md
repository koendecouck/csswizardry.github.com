This summer I'm ditching QWERTY typing in favor of DVORAK, which offers a dramatic increase in typing speed and improved hand posture (I can testify from personal experience now).

QWERTY was deliberately sub-optimally designed over a century ago to prevent old 20th century typewriters from jamming. It deliberately gets in the user's way, making you do elaborate finger movements for common combinations. F\*ck that. I've been retraining my muscle memory from the ground up, a long term investment.Â Since I never really learned to use all fingers in QWERTY, the brain stores DVORAK as a separate posture/activity. Even the Belgian keyboard (AZERTY) is still in there somewhere, a relic from childhood. I'm beginning to struggle with that one though, the way a Tesla engineer would struggle indulging steam engines. Enough with this silliness. I just reprogram them now. Do you use DVORAK or a non-standard, ergonomic keyboard? Let me know!
