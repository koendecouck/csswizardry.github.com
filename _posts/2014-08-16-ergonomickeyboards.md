Ever since my recent efforts on <strong>Dvorak typing </strong>(see last post), I've obtained a casual interest in ergonomic keyboards. 
<!--more-->
An <b>ergonomic keyboard</b> is a <a title="Computer keyboard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard">computer keyboard</a> <a title="Keyboard layout" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout">designed</a> with <a title="Ergonomics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics">ergonomic</a> considerations to minimize muscle strain and a host of related problems.<span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span>Typically such keyboards for two-handed typists are constructed in a V shape, to allow right and left hands to type at a slight angle more natural to the human form. Considering how much time is spend working on computers, it is interesting how we haven't optimized the keyboard design. One quick look into the topic reveals a surprising diversity in designs, which illustrates how new and unexplored that design space is. If it had enjoyed a reasonable history of research attention, you would expect to see a great deal more conversion. Variety is nice for those with a more exploratory outlook (like myself): I was fortunate enough to get my hands on a number of ergonomic keyboards through unofficial channels at the University of Washington (Photo). I enjoyed comparing their design merits. Interestingly they all rely on a QWERTY layout, even the hand pads.</p>
I've found a number of online fora which actively discuss and exchange keyboard designs. Most users seem to be IT professional or passionate hobbyists, cheeky self referencing them as 'geeks'. But then as Alexandra Robbins puts it: "<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8535464-the-geeks-shall-inherit-the-earth">Geeks shall inherit the Earth</a>". These guys are just one step ahead of the rest of us. I recommend checking out QQQ if you want to read more or join in on the discussion. Also Matt Harrisson, a data science consultant, wrote a very good blog post which got me interested in the topic: <a href="http://hairysun.com/blog/2013/04/02/oh-ergonomic-keyboard/">"Oh (Ergonomic) Keyboard, Where Art Thou?"</a>. For Matt the perfect keyboard has the following features:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ergonomic</strong>: The board is designed with the user in mind, minimizing muscle strain and maximizing a natural comfortable form.</li>
	<li><strong>Mechanical Switches: </strong>Modern keyboard are membrane based, using rubber dome switches. This definitely seems a contest with pro's and con's. A rubber dome keyboard design is inexpensive, spill-resistant, less noisy and requires less muscle exertion to use. They break faster however and 'feel different' to typists. The older generation of mechanical keyboard provides tactile and audible feedback when a key is pressed, a nice way of saying that they are <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/240939/mechanical_keyboards_should_you_switch_.html">loud and heavy</a>. The different associated exertion makes them different to use, and inspires different preferences. Personally, I think the argument for mechanical switches is mainly because proponents were muscle trained on such a board. It probably does make their movements feel more natural. In my case, having been muscle trained on a rubber dome keyboard, I experience mechanical keyboards as slow and clunky.</li>
	<li><strong>Split: </strong>Ergonomic keyboards typically consists of two halves (one for each hand), adding to a more natural interaction and less twisting to get your hands close together in an unnatural position.</li>
	<li><strong>Matrix: </strong>The layout of the keys can be either staggered (default layout) or arranged with straight lines (matrix layout). As Matt puts it: "Your fingers on both hands don’t naturally point up and to the left, and your keyboard shouldn’t either". Why would keys be staggered in the first place? Turns out that just like QWERTY, this is a relic of the typewriter era where a staggered layout was used to fit the mechanical linkages between the keys and the levers [<a href="http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/40390/why-are-keyboard-keys-staggered">source</a>].</li>
	<li><strong>Thumb keys: </strong>Humans have opposable thumbs. Yet most people only use one thumb to type on one key. That seems to be a huge waste. Many of the more modern keyboards have keys for the thumbs.</li>
	<li><strong>Programmable: </strong>Programmable keyboards allow you create a layout for QWERTY, DVORAK, COLEMAK. It also allows personalized, custom layouts with any configuration you find more comfortable (incl. those keys under the thumbs). Keyboard layouts can also be changed through the system settings on your OS. A programmable keyboard however stores the configuration internally, allowing you to take it anywhere, plug it in and work using maximum comfort without having to reconfigure the local PC first.</li>
	<li><strong>Open Source: </strong>With the design in the open, users are free to step in and help improve the device based on experience. Given how young ergonomic keyboard design is, this would no doubt be a mayor benefit.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Conclusion: </strong>

I have become convinced of the merit of using specifically designed keyboards for the information age, detached from design decisions for industrial age typewriters. These decisions were not user focused nor intended for use modern devices like laptops and ipads. Keyboards have become our most prominent tools of human-computer. It is amazing how badly adapted they are for this task. What stands in the way of using them is their high retail price and - as is so often the case in innovation - strong role models to show us the way.
