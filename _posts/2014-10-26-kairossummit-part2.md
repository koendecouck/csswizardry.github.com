Last weekend at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel, California, The Kairos Global Summit brought together over 600 people, including 350 young entrepreneurs from 59 countries, the 2014 Kairos 50, over 150 mentors ranging from VCs to engineers, corporate leaders to members of the press, and lead Innovation Partners, GE, Cisco, Sprint, and Johnson and Johnson.

The purpose of the Kairos Global Summit was to showcase the Kairos 50, and accelerate the collaboration with the leaders of today to create lasting partnerships that help young entrepreneurs expand their businesses to global markets. It was an awesome opportunity to network with businesses from around the world, and take a few notes on the localization of their products.

I got a few paragraphs far in writing before I realized I was spending precious time telling effectively the same story again. So instead I decided to share his post, with all credit to Thomas. I might come back and revisit this post once I get more time.</em>

The Kairos 50 represent the 50 most promising ventures from around the world working to solve major problems, with founders under age 25. Kairos 50 ventures have customers and/or prototypes, and the Kairos Society helps drive them to market. The Kairos Global Summit was a stage for them to present their ambitious ideas, and they gained valuable advice from mentors and initiated business partnerships that are already proving useful as they take their businesses to market. This year 42% of the K50 are based internationally, representing 15 countries.

K50 entrepreneur, Connor Landgraf, co-founder of Eko Devices, described the Kairos Global Summit by saying, “The energy level was great. People were passionate about the spaces they’re working on, and I’m shocked at the amount of incredible people here under the age of 25 – it’s humbling.”

The Lead Innovation Partners helped attendees explore future market tracks in robotics, healthcare, mobile data, and the internet of everything, industries with some of the greatest potential to transform the world in which we live. With this, they revealed the enormous potential for entrepreneurs to make a global impact through engaging with large, experienced companies. As Alex Tepper, Managing Director of GE Ventures explained, “The days of closed insular development are gone, thankfully. Now we partner with entrepreneurs and help scale technologies.”

Kaan Kilik, Sprint’s Mobile Commerce Manager, continued on this idea by saying, “We were once a startup. We need entrepreneurs to drive us home and create new ecosystems. Ideas are most powerful when they’re shared, especially in small spaces like this. We’re very interested in Kairos’ success, as you will be the ones creating new ecosystems.”

The Kairos Summit put this power of sharing ideas in a small space to the test, during a rapid ideation session which capped off the future market tracks portion of the summit. With young entrepreneurs sitting at tables in groups of ten, we all witnessed the power of collaboration as our global group came up with fairly advanced and uniformly innovative business ideas in 20 minutes. From a swarm of drones that acts as an emergency response team, to a “drink drum” that identifies the quality of water in a drum, the creativity and innovation was boundless.

On Friday night at the Banquet Dinner, we learned what inspired K50 entrepreneurs to solve major problems, the lessons they learned along the way, and how they plan to move forward with their ideas.

Daniel Gomez, co-founder of <a href="http://www.solben.org.mx/">Solben</a>, shared how he transformed his idea in biodiesel production from a hobby in his family’s kitchen to a multi-million dollar business that controls 80% of the Mexican biodiesel market. More on Daniel’s story is available <a href="http://blog.kairossociety.org/k50-profile-daniel-gomez/">here</a>, including a video.

Raheem Bello, co-founder of <a href="http://www.detonationdynamics.com/">Detonation Dynamics</a>, shared how one night of looking at the stars in Nigeria inspired him to pursue a PHD in astrophysics and develop a new, more efficient engine that uses a technology called detonation.  His ultimate dream is to be the first man on Mars. More on Raheem’s story is available <a href="http://blog.kairossociety.org/the-2014-kairos-global-summit-in-review/%3Ca%20href=">here</a>.

Colleen Costello, co-founder of <a href="http://www.vitalvio.com/">Vital Vio</a>, explained how she developed a LED fixture that provides general white illumination to a room while safely disinfecting all of the surfaces in places like hospitals, clean rooms, and restaurants.

Iñigio Rumayor, a 2013 K50 alum and co-founder of <a href="https://www.regalii.com/en">Regalii</a>, described how being a part of the Kairos community helped him in his drive to create a mobile app that allows simple international money transfers to distant relatives.

Friday’s Banquet Dinner also included a fun game show that saw young entrepreneurs go head-to-head with experienced mentors to create businesses to solve fantastical apocalyptic problems in a limited amount of time. Notably, Tim Draper, Founder of venture capital firm <a href="http://dfj.com/">Draper Fisher Jurvetson</a>, and Neil Jacobstein, Co-chair of the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Track at <a href="http://singularityu.org/">Singularity University</a>, came up with their own solution to a dinosaur apocalypse: a nursery that trained dinosaurs to eat waste and release daisies in place of feces. The winning team was Alex Kern and Sean Linehan, with their ridiculous solution involving using Godzilla to eat nuclear waste and solve for world peace.

The Kairos team also released a mobile voting system, WOW, that incentivized meaningful personal interactions and turned every event attendee into a participant in deciding which K50 companies would take the stage during the summit’s Fast Pitch Roulette closing session.

During Saturday’s K50 Showcase, the spotlight focused directly on the entrepreneurs who make up the K50 and their ambitious companies. The Ballroom was filled with exhibits that displayed the companies’ products, and attendees had the chance to personally meet the founders and demo their products. Companies such as <a href="http://blog.kairossociety.org/the-creators-project-features-k50-company-embr-labs/">Embr Labs</a> and <a href="http://blog.kairossociety.org/featured-fellow-raheem-bello/">Detonation Dynamics</a> were on full display, along with the rest of the K50. The K50 Showcase was focused on outcomes, including the potential for investment and distribution partners and invitations to speak on stages around the world. Stay tuned in the coming days for some exciting announcements as specific outcomes are already being finalized!

Following the K50 Showcase, there were break-out sessions and workshops that covered topics such as digital finance, legal actions founders should take, and video marketing techniques. This time also allowed K50 founders to have curated one-on-one meetings with mentors (ranging from Barney Pell, NASA’s former chief strategist, to Lynn Tilton, CEO of Patriarch Partners) who provided actionable feedback on product strategy, branding, distribution, investors, partners, and more.

The Kairos Global Summit ended with a fast paced pitch session featuring the five K50 companies with the most “WOWs,” who gave two minute pitches about their businesses to the entire crowd of attendees. The pitches were passionate, specific, and quite polished, and all the more so given that each presenter was given just a few moments notice.

Finally, Alex Fiance, CEO of The Kairos Society, closed out the summit as he explained how moving forward, Kairos is focusing on directly accelerating K50 companies by increasing their exposure and devoting resources to helping them form more strategic partnerships with large companies, media platforms, and mentors. He emphasized how Kairos is about relationships, and that everyone should continue to take advantage of the fact that passionate people from 59 countries are gathered in the same place with common goals.

After a weekend filled with inspiring ideas, networking, and newly formed business partnerships and friendships, the Kairos Global Summit closed with a celebratory dance party, featuring <a href="http://rac.fm/">RAC</a>. I can’t wait to see everyone at next year’s global summit, and in the meantime, upcoming Kairos regional summits around the world.
