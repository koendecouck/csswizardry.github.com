Last week I was part of the Belgian delegation of young entrepreneurs attending the Kairos Global Summit in Laguna Niguel, California. The summit represents a tech cocktail packed with inspiring and useful workshops for entrepreneurs seeking to take their companies to the next level. It brings together Kairos fellows from around the globe with world leaders across business, technology and politics to discuss pressing global challenges and innovative market-driven solutions. Given how we assembled from all over the world, it was a rare opportunity to learn and network. In this post I'll reflect briefly on the experience and share some of my notes.

Here is a personal note written by one of the people I met there, Lucas Koster (the Netherlands), on how he drives innovation in his work.

The number of nationalities represented was simply staggering. I think I spoke to entrepreneurs from pretty much every continent, a mini United Nations of people committed to helping others and pushing the world. Just about all of the attendees were below 25, and CEO's of big companies. There was huge amount of asset value represented in the Ritz hotel those days. Everyone spoke fluent English, incl. the Chinese, Russians or the native Spanish speakers. It was beautiful, with very animated conversations across culture. The unofficial status of English says a lot about the direction the world is going. We didn't need to be as politically correct as the real U.N.
Even so, you'd periodically overhear a small group of people talking in a native language: whispers of Portuguese or Mandarin. I heard some fellows revert to a native tongue when talking to mentors or investors, people typically of an older generation. I spoke Dutch or French a few times, a deliberate courtesy to accommodate a conversational partner. I had a passionate argument with Miguel Andorffy - who leads one of Brazil's largest online learning platform on STEM - on the importance of teaching people English even before sciences. The idea is that it opens up the world to share innovation in a common medium. An investment in the lingua franca is key to learning and sharing innovation. By breaking down these barriers we finally create an emerging global intelligence of entrepreneurship and innovation.

<strong>Event partners</strong>
As the digital and physical world continue to converge, billion dollar market opportunities are opening up at the intersections of robotics, IoE (Internet of Everything), mobile data and healthcare. Experts from GE, Cisco, Sprint, and Johnson & Johnson provided an exclusive peek into their bets on where these industries are heading and the investments they are making in the future. 
Aside from panelists from these companies, we also had talks from the president or vice-president from these companies in person, with personal Q&A afterwards. Of course the real opportunity laid in engaging these speakers at the receptions before (or if you were lucky after) their talk. I thought Johnson & Johnson in particular made a very passionate statement about the future of healthcare, although Pankaj Srivastava (Vice president of Cisco) made solid points on the IoE. As someone with a big data background, his points really resonated with me and we ended up talking for a long time afterwards. It was great to see how these established companies do their best to fundamentally invest in positive change, and helping out younger start-ups. It made me reflect on my usual reserved or suspicious attitude in dealing with them. Obviously these giants have great talent and resources in-house that they're sometimes be willing to share.

Some key notes:
Cisco:
- There are more than 500 proposed API standards out there. Every company typically makes their own, sometimes even different ones for different devices. That kind of 'localization' is stupid: it pisses of the consumer and stops us from linking technologies in a much smarter 'internet of everything'.
- We need more open data, especially on critical issues such as community power management, water usage, etc... Cities need that kind of feedback and are currently hardly getting it.
- Of particular concern is managing infrastructure in places that are hard to reach. Not just villages, but also oil rigs or technology that goes deep into mine shafts.
- The solution is not to build yet another 'better' API, but to abstract from existing ones. Build a protocol that talks to multiple devices. (Personal opinion: We will still need international ISO standards)
- Ultimately the greatest challenges right now are on how to provide value for the 'last mile', those hard to reach places on Earth.

Sprint:
- Use big data to make relevant, more personalized offers
- Cut foreign retailers in for some of the profit when they work with you or actively endorse your product. You need these people on the ground who are known and trusted by the community, even if you did do your cultural research. (Example: <a href="http://www.globe.com.ph/gcash">GCash, Philippines</a>)

<strong>Foreign entrepreneurs</strong>
I talked to A LOT of people in the 2-3 days of the conference. A couple of them stood out for me:
<em>- Nikola Yanev (Bulgaria)</em>

<em>- Leonardo Marcovitz (Israel)</em>

<em>- Doug Hoernle (South Africa)</em>

<em>- Miguel Andorffy (Brazil)</em>

<em>- Shawn Park (USA/South-Korea)</em> 
UI Designer & Founder at Iris

<em>- (India)</em>

<em>- Tiago Borges Coelho (Mozambique)</em>
Local leaders in UX and working on ICT4D projects. They also host the biggest job platform of the region.
