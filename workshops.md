A large portion of my working life is spent running workshops and training
events for clients all over the globe. From the smallest of independent
companies, to large organisations, I have taught hundreds
of people how to setup scalable Hadoop environments and how to
make substantial savings on their network load.

I have a number of pre-written workshops that are suitable for one- or two-day
engagements, or we can work on something a little more bespoke—just [get in
touch](/contact/).

With a truly international reputation, my workshops have been delivered from Puerto Rico to the UK, the Netherlands to the US. You’re in good hands.

## Hadoop 101

The newer of my workshops, this master class will introduce a company's IT network team to the inner workings of Hadoop, and answer any questions regarding the performance of different products and providers currently on the market.
You will learn

* the business impact of good performance;
* how hadoop really works, and how to play to its strengths and weaknesses;
* how to optimise your data for frequent access vs longterm storage;
* how to measure network performance;
* how to detect and troubleshoot performance issues;
* how to guarantee user information privacy and setup data retention policies
* how to prepare for the performance landscape of tomorrow.

  <p>We hired Koen to provide hadoop consultancy on a range of highly trafficked media platforms for Belgium's largest private media company. His detailed and intricate knowledge of how Hadoop systems work allowed him to improve performance by over 400%, all without
  sacrificing or removing any assets or features from any platform. By
  analysing how data was streaming in, he optimised and restructured things in such a way that we now collect business insights near-instantaneously, whereas before this always involved a significant retrospective exercise. </p>

My performance work has been implemented on very highly trafficked and
high-availability media platforms, enabling the parent company to monitor user engagement and be immediately aware of anomalies. dramatic improvements in automation, data quality and data availability were made without
sacrificing the quality or integrity of any of the client's content or assets.

## Hadoop Architecture

My signature workshop has been constantly updated and running for more than two
years now, with new materials introduced as they become relevant. Attendees will
learn

* a high level overview of available hadoop services
* how to scale data capacity in anticipation of future needs;
* pros and cons on services to boost cluster security, enable streamed log data, etc;
* how to pick the proper hardware (at optimal price point) for running Hadoop clusters;
* and a whole host more.

  <p>Koen's knowledge and experience was tremendously
  helpful in getting this developer team ready for our own architecture overhaul, and his
  time here left us with some much needed help and guidance. He’s a great
  communicator with great ideas, and essential in getting a team on the
  same page.</p>
