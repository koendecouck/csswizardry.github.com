By combining demographics, personality data and sexual preferences from about 7000 couples, I created the biggest study ever made of the science of love (at least at the time!). The results were remarkable.

<strong>Abstract</strong>
Clearly partner choice is an important preoccupation in our lives: 43 percent of Americans over the age of 18 are single and actively looking for a partner (US Census, 2009). Divorce rates are at an all-time high. Personality similarity is often assumed part of how a meaningful partner connection is made, yet despite decades of research the effects remain unclear and large-scale studies are still lacking. Here, personality similarity from 7,118 couples was estimated using Big Five and life satisfaction scores from the Facebook application myPersonality. Similarity was quantified using rescaled D-indices (Cronbach & Gleser, 1953), Pearson correlation and the intraclass correlation (McCrae, 2008). All three indices showed consistent positive assortative mating by personality, with individuals choosing a partner more similar than friends or unrelated couples. Similarity did not vary for people in different stages of a relationship (dating phase, engagement and marriage) and was consistent across all Big Five traits. The same preference towards similarity was found for homosexual couples. On the individual level, high scores on conscientiousness and extraversion and a low score on agreeableness, predicted an increased chance of being in a relationship. These results suggest personality similarity is a reliable early criterion in couple formation, yet not specifically tied to relationship success.

A plethora of research has investigated the different attractors in dating. Physical attractiveness dominates as the most important factor (Braun et al., 2001), followed by intelligence (Escorial & Martin-Buro, 2012) and personality (Decuyper, Debolle & De Fruyt, 2012). Higher scores on all three are preferred (we all want a partner that is handsome, smart AND kind). However a matching score is superior predictor on whether the couple will stay together. In other words, we settle for the best we can get: a partner of about equal attractiveness, intelligence and charm.

To explain this graph, let me start by stating the statistical results behind it first:
• n= 144,707
• In a relationship: 
Logistic regression: sig. effect of individual’s O+, E+, A+, N+, p<.001. Sig effect C+, p<0.05
• Married: 
Logistic regression: sig. effect of individual’s O-, C+, N+, p<.001
• Point-biserial correlations: 
All traits: ~ .03 (relationship)
C: r = 0.12 (married)

Interpretation:
For this particular test I looked at 144,707 people (people that are either in a relation, engaged or married). This amount is far greater than my 7000 couples because here I didn't care <em>who</em> they were seeing. A logistical regression showed statistically significant effects in predicting relationships for the personality traits of 'openness' (O), 'extraversion' (E), 'agreeableness' (A),'neuroticism' (N) and conscientiousness (C). All the effects were positive, meaning that if you have 'more' of these traits, your chances for dating are higher. Put another way, people that are more liberal (high O), more outgoing (high E), more submissive (high A), more sensitive to stress (high N) and more diligent and orderly (high C) are more successful in moving from 'single' to 'in a relationship'.
As for moving from dating into marriage, that requires you to be less liberal and more traditional (low O), very diligent and orderly (high C) and very sensitive to stress again (high N).

The point-biserial correlations denote that these effects are really, really tiny though. A lot probably depends on the circumstances and each individual's mojo. The biggest correlation is for 'being diligent' predicting marriage. So yes, marriage does require you work on it.
