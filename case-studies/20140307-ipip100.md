The 100-Item IPIP NEO-PI-R is an online Big-Five Personality questionnaire that provides scientifically valid feedback on your personality traits and typology. It is used in HR and real psychological research.

<p><strong>My Work</strong></p>
<p>I build this questionnaire solo as a side-project during my time at the University of Cambridge. It is a showcase demo of the <a href="http://www.psychometrics.cam.ac.uk/newconcerto">Concerto platform</a>: it computes the results for you immediately, with instant feedback. I build it using a combination of HTML, CSS, Java, R script and SQL. The concept is based on the myPersonality app by dr. David Stillwell.</p>
