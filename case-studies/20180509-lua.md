I keep a lot of personal projects after hours. Most are written in Scala or Python, but I do write Lua too, mostly when it's game related. I've created Minecraft mods that were written Lua, and designed custom 3D character models for the Unity engine which I then wrote a Lua AI for.
Both are quite rewarding, especially when you see other people download and use them. I occationally make some extra money off selling these products too.

## Summary

* After hours programming in Lua, writing character AI's or creating custom game mods.

## The project

Since these are after hours projects, they vary on my interests at the time. Documented below are a few screenshots from code written for Unity engine applications. I'm engaged with several small niche communities interested in that work.

## Screenshots

At the time of writing I have around 55 character models, along with multiple decors, 3D mesh objects for them to interact with, custom sounds, behavior scripts and more. I either trade or sell these with people in the industry, or use it as an artistic outlet for 3D modelling.

My coding style tends to be well documentated with in-code comments. I make a conscious effort to demystify what a snippet does in order to support clients and/or the community who might want to build on it. The snippet above is a wrapper for 'EnableAI()', the only complication being a sound file being played to signal that the function was called.
