<p><a href="/_post_images/2015/10/overview.png">This statistical overview</a> helps you decide which type of analysis is most suited for your data. I originally created as a teaching aid for tutoring statistics to undergraduate students.</p>

Tip: 
- <strong>Outcome variables</strong> are the ones you are interested to learn more about. In 'how does the frequency of smoking affect my risk of cancer?', 'risk of cancer' would be the outcome variable. They're also called 'dependent variables', because their severity depends on the causes you're investigating. It is entirely possible to have more than one outcome variable.
- <strong>Predictors</strong> are those expected causes. In the example above 'frequency of smoking' would we a predictor. Just like outcome variables it is entirely possible to have more than one predictor. 

- <strong>Continuous variables</strong> are variables that represent a possible numerical range.
- <strong>Categorical variables</strong> are variables that are made up of discrete categories.
Whether a variable is continuous or categorical is not a feature of the subject you're measuring, but rather how you chose to measure it. In our example 'risk of cancer' might be a continuous outcome variable if you -say- represented it with a percentage. But it would be a categorical outcome variable if you represented it in discrete groups of 'low risk', 'medium risk' or 'high risk'.

You'd also want to familiarize yourself with <strong><a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/checking-glm-model-assumptions-in-r/">the assumptions of parametric tests</a></strong>, also known as the assumptions of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM). If these assumptions are met, the techniques available to you are generally a whole lot easier.
