MeshLab, 3D modeling

During the Indian elections of 2014, I led a team in making a fully interactive representation of Indian Politics. Try clicking it!

<p><strong>Build time</strong></p>
<p>10 weeks with a 3 man crew. <em>(Note: I was developing a solo project, <a href="http://koendecouck.com/?portfolio=talks-uw">Talks.UW</a>, at the same time).</em></p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>With its 1.27 billion residents and rapidly growing economy, India constitutes an important player in global politics and trade. India also represents the largest democracy in the world. However, for many decades, lack of publicly available records prevented any large-term political insight. During the Indian Elections of 2014, local politicians were spending huge sums on their campaigns for Lok Sabha, the Parliament of the People. <em>Millions of Indian voters were looking for information</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
Our team of three (myself, Tridiv Sardesai and Nicholas Throm) designed an interactive visualization that promotes informed political participation for the people of India. At the time, this was <em>the most comprehensive visual overview ever made of Indian politics</em>. Aside from metrics commonly reported by newspapers (age, gender, constituency), our visualization included performance-based metrics such as attendence records, spendings and criminal history. By deploying it online for free, we were able to inspire a wide Indian audience. Our work also employed a meticulous set of human-centered research and design methods, including...
<ul>
	<li>Ethnographic research</li>
	<li>Local and long distance interviewing</li>
	<li>Market research/competitive analysis</li>
	<li>Local and long distance interviewing</li>
	<li>Personas</li>
	<li>data set diagramming</li>
	<li>Personas/User scenarios</li>
	<li>AOF method</li>
	<li>Cardsorting/affinity diagramming</li>
	<li>Information architecture</li>
	<li>Thumbnail sketches</li>
	<li>Lofi and hifi wireframes</li>
	<li>Mock-ups</li>
</ul>

The Indian elections were extensively covered by prominent media outlets across the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok5.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok5.png" alt="lok5" width="800" height="427" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4439" /></a>
<strong>Three personas based on our user research</strong>. We talked to Indian users and performed a deep study of the different socioeconomic regions and class perceptions in India. Each persona included a one-page fact sheet with data sources on their depicted user type.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok8.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok8.png" alt="lok8" width="800" height="434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4440" /></a>
<strong>All data variables from our visualization</strong>. We compiled this data set ourselves from multiple sources and different data formats. Considerable time was spend scrubbing and interpreting the data.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok12.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok12.png" alt="lok12" width="800" height="423" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4441" /></a>
<strong>Rapid paper prototypes, with different graph types</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok13.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok13.png" alt="lok13" width="800" height="408" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4442" /></a>
We gathered user feedback on every element of the visualization: does it feel right to you?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok14.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok14.png" alt="lok14" width="800" height="421" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4443" /></a>
<strong>Portable whiteboards</strong>. Aside from the traditional user-centered design techniques, we developed two techniques of our own. Portable whiteboards is a bottom up approach which involves users thinking aloud while drawing how they envision the product to act. Designer and developer take notes on what users consider essential features. In each case the map of India emerged as the most prominent visual element.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok16.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok16.png" alt="lok16" width="800" height="422" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4444" /></a>
We explored many different interface structures hierarchies. Note how we build on user findings (the map of India is preserved as the most prominent visual element) while discussing how to intuitively represent data dependencies around the expectations communicated by the user.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/IMG_0003-6b.jpg"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/IMG_0003-6b.jpg" alt="IMG_0003 (6)b" width="800" height="446" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4466" /></a>
<strong>Variable sorting</strong>. The second technique I developed myself to help my team meaningfully communicate about this dataset. It involves a data set diagram on whiteboard (left), with every variable written out on a post-it. The colors indicate variable issues such as completeness. A second whiteboard acts akin to a low fidelity prototype (right). Variable post-its are rapidly exchanged between the two boards during the discussion.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok20.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok20.png" alt="lok20" width="800" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4445" /></a>
We developed two high fidelity prototypes. Both versions were fully functional and explored a number of designer choices. The first design was characterized by a lot of textual instructions, acting as clues to each visualization. It includes one global filter and a choropleth map displaying population density. All graphs provide further detail on demand. The second design adds more visual reference points at the expense of text instructions. It tries to stimulate interest by including visual elements such as a national banner and political caricatures of prominent Indian politicians. Though not strictly necessary from an infovis point of view (<a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">Tufte 1983</a>), these elements enliven the display and help guide the user’s gaze in a better way than white space would.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok21.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok21.png" alt="lok21" width="800" height="416" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4446" /></a>
We performed usability tests on both designs. The first half of these tests was performed locally in the US with Indian participants. The second half of usability tests was performed remotely with users in India. Challenges included poor local internet connectivity and smaller bandwidth. The testing setup was balanced as a 2x2 factorial design.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok22.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok22.png" alt="lok22" width="800" height="460" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4447" /></a>
We combined our findings in a final product. This final design adds a second global filter, and reverts the choropleth to a geographical map of India. The map is also larger and more centrally placed to draw the user’s attention. It introduces a table near the top with more detailed information, depending on which representatives are selected. Finally, a number of smaller esthetic changes were made such as a more coherent style for barcharts and re-positioning of different visual elements </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok23.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok23.png" alt="lok23" width="800" height="434" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4448" /></a>
The new design was again tested against user reactions in a comprehensive usability test.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/_post_images/2014/08/lok25.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/lok25.png" alt="lok25" width="800" height="419" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4449" /></a>
User feedback was highly positive, with many commenting on the enjoyable, low-access nature of the interactive design.</p>
