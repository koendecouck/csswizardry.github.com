In 2014 I wrote a 32 page report on the Hirsch Index, an author-level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of a scientist or scholar. I evaluated the effectiveness of different alternatives, supported by text mining techniques, natural language processing (NLP) and network analysis.

<strong>Abstract</strong>
This project involved a bibliometric study of scientific metrics currently used to evaluate academic professionals. My goals were threefold :
(1) First, I investigated the effect of choosing one metric over another. Which metric is ‘best’? Do these metrics agree with popular perception?
(2) Secondly, I presented ‘Advanced P-rank’, a researcher ranking metric inspired on a variation of PageRank and different web 2.0 features. PageRank complements traditional metrics by incorporating the authority of the citing source and its density of citations into the algorithm. In addition, web 2.0 provides ways to model community perception of the researcher in a way not covered by traditional metrics.
(3) Thirdly, I presented ‘Advanced pattern recognition’, a neural modeling technique that uses citation data to refine the online search results in databases like Web of Science, Scopus or Google Scholar. These intelligent search results ultimately lead to greater accuracy and reliability for all metrics.
