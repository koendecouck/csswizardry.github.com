An exploratory study of the MyPersonality app data, a big data repository that includes > 6 million test results and data from 4 million users worldwide!

<p>
myPersonality was a popular Facebook application that allowed users to take real psychometric tests, and us to record (with consent!) their psychological and Facebook profile. Currently, the database contains more than 6,000,000 test results together with more than 4,000,000 individual Facebook profiles. Respondents come from various age groups, backgrounds and cultures.

A wide variety of data is included in the data set:

- psychometric tests' scores,
- records of user's Facebook profiles,
- test item level data,
- some additional information - e.g. records of users' Likes.

I calculated scores, recoded variables, removed invalid records, anonymized results, etc.

Below is an illustration of the diversity of respondents, made by 'hacking' R's graphing function. I created it by plotting a random sample of users' latitude and longitude, as taken from the database.
