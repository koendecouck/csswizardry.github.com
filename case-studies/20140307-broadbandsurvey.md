Open BPS (Open Broadband Performance Survey) is a survey report on Seattle's broadband network. It was part of the Open Data Day Hackathon, hosted by Google Inc. I was interested in finding (or building) a large set of data on how broadband Internet connections actually perform. The original questions that got me thinking about this were discussed at a City of Seattle Citizens Telecommunications and Technology Advisory Board (@CTTAB) meeting: What is a good minimum level of broadband service? What is the proportion of claimed vs actual service range?

<p><strong>My Work</strong></p>
<p>Given my research background I worked on all stages of the process, particularly the survey design, data analysis and data visualization.</p>
