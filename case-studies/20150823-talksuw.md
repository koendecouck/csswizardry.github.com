I took on the challenge to research, design and build a complete talks platform for the University of Washington. The rules: No resources, a 10 week deadline and all had to be done solo.

<p><strong>Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Many new initiatives are popping up all over the University of Washington focusing on bringing together campus resources and fostering interdepartmental collaboration. In January 2014 president Young announced the launch of <a href="https://www.washington.edu/wholeu/">The Whole U</a>, an initiative to increase the accessibility of resources currently spread out over campus. Similarly, Michael B. Bragg, dean of the college of Engineering, called 'promoting greater interdepartmental collaboration within the college' one of the strategic goals for the following academic terms.</p>
<p>The dean approached the student council on how to accomplish this, asking to draft a couple of suggestions. As a user experience designer, I started sketching a few ideas. My proposal was to unite all the scheduled talks on campus into a single system. Making talks visible to everyone would make  interdisciplinary collaborations into a naturally emergent property.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for success</strong></p>
<p>Based on preliminary meetings with UW staff members and student advisory council, I outlined the 
following goals and research questions. I also conducted an expert heuristic review on talks.cam 
(University of Cambridge), which served as a baseline to identify the areas of focus for the first user interviews.</p>

<em>Goals</em>
<ol>
1. Investigate talk attendance, audience diversity and people’s motivations for attending talks.
2. Evaluate the use and effectiveness of current methods
3. Better understand and quantify the desired features for a new dedicated system
4. Provide actionable recommendations for such a system.
</ol>

<em>Research Questions</em>
<ol>
1. How often are talks attended?
2. In what capacity are talks typically attended? (Voluntary?)
3. How familiar are people with talks happening inside/outside their department?
4. What media are typically used to find out about talks? Which is the primary medium?
5. What are the ways in which this experience can be improved?
</ol>

<p>Design would be made from a user-centered perspective, informed by user research. Popular requested functionality would need to be central to the design. Success would depend on delivering an at least minimal viable product on time. Development success would translate in a system that operates within the university's IT ecosystem with core functionality intact and a minimum of bugs. It would also need to be understandable and easy to maintain by UW IT services.</p>

<p>As a non-staff member of the university I could not claim to any financial resources, workspace or hired others. I would need to bring all the pieces together myself, and assemble them in the proper order.</p>

<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
I started by writing out a project proposal and drawing up a schedule with intermediary deliverables. I identified a couple of initiatives on campus that might be interested partners and reached out to them.
The first phase of research involved doing <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/research-presentation.pdf">exploratory interviews</a>. The goal was to learn what users were using now, whether there was something I might have missed and see what’s out there. I also gathered some info on their needs and desired functionality. I generally like to start there as a way to get a feel for the field.
Afterwards I fed those results into a <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/research-presentation.pdf">structured online survey</a>. I launched it the next week, along with a <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/research-presentation.pdf">social media campaign</a> to generate traffic. While that was happening I hosted a small <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/research-presentation.pdf">focus group</a> to prioritize the needs identified in the interviews. This is also the phase in which I did <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/research-presentation.pdf">competitive analysis</a>. I also consulted with Ryota Tomioka (University of Tokyo) and Raymond Chan (University of Cambridge), both IT professionals that I knew were independently working on a similar system. My online survey yielded 182 responses.

For the design phase I performed rapid iterative testing on several <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/design-presentation.pdf">low fidelity prototypes</a>. This step of the process was meant to explore different possible user interfaces that meet the user's expectations and needs. I used a technique called paper prototyping, which involves creating rough, even hand-sketched, drawings of an interface to use as models of a design. Paper prototypes have the benefit of saving time and money. It allows you to rapidly respond to user suggestions by easy modification of the design, making it very useful as an early design tool. Another benefit of paper prototyping is that users feel more comfortable being critical of the mock up because it doesn't have a polished look yet.

Low fidelity prototyping was then followed by the development of a <a href="http://students.washington.edu/kdecouck/">high-fidelity online prototype</a>. Because of the time constraint associated with the project, I decided to forgo dedicated high fidelity prototyping tools and use early development builds instead. The advantage was that I was able to quickly correct problems as they developed.

Development originally began in Ruby on Rails. After a few days I had to switch to a php based build however, since I needed UW webmaster privileges to access the necessary server settings. A php build was less powerful, but faster and easier for IT staff to maintain afterwards.

Finally I performed two on-site <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/593-Final-report.pdf">usability testing</a> sessions to validate the design and iron out any final bugs before product launch. Both users noted high satisfaction with the product, stating that they were ‘very likely’ to use the platform in the future. They were also ‘very likely’ to recommend it to colleagues and friends. 
I also designed and produced a <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/poster-preview.png">poster</a> and flyers, illustrating the product and its development process.

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<strong>Talks.uw</strong> is a proposed online calendar platform that shows all talks happening around UW campus. In addition to the main calendar it offers advanced search functionality. The following is a list of notable working features which I demonstrated to the client:

<a href="/_post_images/2014/08/circle6.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/08/circle6.png" alt="circle6" width="165" height="162" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4502" /></a>

<ul>
• Search by topic, department, date
• Interactive department calendars
• Show events as list/per month
• Google maps integration
• UW NetID login for staff
• Animated menu's with UW house style and fade-out effects
• Responsive design (desktop, tablet and smartphone compatible)
</ul>
Talks.UW participated in the University of Washington's <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/open-house">HCDE Open House event</a>. Jury members were unanimously impressed by the scope and quality of the product, and I received special praise from a number of attending Microsoft UX professionals. It was submitted as an implementation proposal to the office of the President and UW IT services in June 2014. UW IT staff were very excited to receive it. 

<p><strong>Future work</strong></p>
<p>Given more time I would like to have continued on the original Ruby design for the site, which promised to have greater capacity and control then the php based version I presented. One fascinating idea would be to create a more general Ruby based talks system that any institution can use. Local webmasters would only need to change the logo and initialize a fresh database. After discussing the idea with <a href="http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk/page/raymond-chan">Raymond Chan</a> (University of Cambridge), he invited me to work with his team to take the Talks.university idea to the Cloud. His own instance, <a href="http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/talks-functional-outline.pdf">talks.cam</a>, has a publically available functional outline.</p>

<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Talks.uw was hard work, but also a very rewarding experience. Working through the full R&D process gave me a better idea of the full development process in companies. By living through it myself, I now better understand the different sensitivities of researchers, designers and developers. That may help me to better understand expectations that come with my own role or dealing with colleagues of different skill sets.</p>

<p>I put in a lot of work in on this, because I believe in talks.uw’s capacity to enrich campus life. It was the user-centered design process however that made it all possible. There was constant contact with the university client and I continuously went back and forth to the user: trying out new designs, or just asking questions. Which accounts for the happy ending to this story.</p>
