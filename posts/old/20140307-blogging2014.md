One of my resolutions in 2014 and something that I hope to stay consistent in doing, is blogging. Blogging itself feels unnatural to me: maybe because I dislike long obfuscated text, which seems what blogging implies. It feels dull or pedantic coming from someone who still stands so early in life. None the less, I've been encouraged to write about my professional experiences ever since I arrived in the USA.

I've been considering blogging for a few months now. Friends have been asking me to write about my travels and the grant agencies like to hear personal success stories. Blogging has been optional in both cases, and I'm afraid I'm still not going to accommodate them. I'm an IT guy, I appreciate efficiency. My daily expressions are short straightforward statements and my twitter feed is a stream of well-considered content. Poetic writing isn't my style. Instead, what I want to share here is a window into my UX professional experiences: the things I do, what I've learned, and my thoughts about them.
My rational for this is partially selfish: some of this stuff is good to have for future reference (Did you see the search bar on top?). At the same time though I feel like I'm sharing that knowledge with anyone willing to learn.

You can expect this blog to be mainly about HCDE class work as I progress through my masters at the <a href="www.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>. My thanks go out to Patrick Dugan, teammate and friend, who inadvertently convinced me of its uses. The title and first sentence are a wink and tribute to him. I also like to thank prof. <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/news/andrew-davidson-joins-hcde-faculty">Andrew Davidson</a>, who is going to use enlightened force next quarter to make students (incl. myself) blog about their capstone experience anyway. One way or another, this blog was going to happen.

Each post will focus on a particular hands-on topic: a technique, project or a piece of software. Each post itself will also include at least one external resource of added value.

For this first post, I'm including a few bookmarked blogs I personally track:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/">The Official Google Blog</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://dub.washington.edu/blog">DUB Blog</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://change.washington.edu/">UW's Change group</a></li>
	<li><a href="www.killerconsultant.com">Killer Consultant</a></li>
</ul>
