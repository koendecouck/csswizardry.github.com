<strong>Week 1 - T</strong><strong>he challenge</strong>

New classes and new challenges await in this new spring quarter. For my HCDE capstone I've decided to do something special. <strong>In the next 9 weeks I will do a project going through every stage UX/UI design process. Solo. </strong> I figure it will be the ultimate test to see how far I've come. To you, the reader, it should illustrate my thought process during a typical day's work.

The deadline is fixed. In nine weeks, I'll hand you a full research report. I'll also present a powerpoint and do a poster session. Best of all, there will be a shiny high fidelity prototype for you to play with. Now, what exactely am I going to build for you?

<strong>The project</strong>

Many new initiatives are popping up all over the University of Washington focusing on bringing together campus resources and fostering interdepartmental collaboration. In January 2014 president Young announced the launch of The Whole U, an initiative to increase the accessibility of resources currently spread out over campus. Similarly, Michael B. Bragg, dean of the college of Engineering, called promoting greater interdepartmental collaboration within the college one of the strategic goals for the following academic terms.

The dean approached the student council on this, asking to draft a couple of suggestions. Being there (I'm doing student representation in between classes) I started playing with a few ideas. I tackle this problem the only way I know how: by engineering the solution. Hey, it's not every day you get the dean as your 'client'.

Talks.uw is a proposed online calendar platform that shows all talks happening around UW campus. In addition to the main calendar it offers advanced search functionality and info on the talk, speaker or series. Users will be able to use their UW login to search by title, author, theme or any combination of parameters. In addition, talks.uw makes adding talks or finding a speaker series’ email list a lot easier. By creating greater visibility of all talks happening on campus, talks.uw cultivates the exchange of ideas both on campus and with UW's wider community.

<strong>Planning</strong>

I started by writing out a project proposal and drawing up a schedule with intermediary deliverables. I've identified a couple of initiatives on campus that might be interested partners. I've reached out to them, the project proposal will be here for them if anyone is interested.

The goal is to learn what users are using now, whether there is something I might have missed and see what's out there. I may also gather some info on their needs and desired functionality. Give the people what they want. Doing interviews is only one of the methods suggested by the IDEO cards. However, I generally like to start there as a way to get a feel for the field.

I plan to launch that next week, along with kicking off a social media campaign to generate traffic. While that's happening I'll host a <strong>focus group</strong> to prioritize the needs identified in the interviews. Once that's done I'll switch to rapid iterative prototyping. Some of those sessions will be scheduled to accommodate participants, however I aim for truly rapid sessions (5 minutes) that will fit in people's breaks. Result: bigger sample size, lots of input!

Stay tuned for the next update!
