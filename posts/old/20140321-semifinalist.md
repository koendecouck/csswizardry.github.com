<strong>VOTE FONEASTRA TO TED TALKS!</strong> <a href="http://bit.ly/1kNbTD9">http://bit.ly/1kNbTD9</a>. Dear reader, I need your social support! My UW project <a href="http://koendecouck.com/?portfolio=foneastra">FoneAstra</a> is currently a semi-finalist for TED at Washington DC! <a href="http://koendecouck.com/?portfolio=foneastra">FoneAstra</a> is a breastmilk pasteurization system, designed specifically as a solution for fighting HIV in Africa. Your Facebook votes decide which idea makes it to the stage and gets realized. Help me change the world, push FoneAstra to TED: <a href="http://bit.ly/1kNbTD9">http://bit.ly/1kNbTD9</a> or donate to the crowdfund: <a href="http://goo.gl/U52TwU">http://goo.gl/U52TwU</a>. Also it would be great if you could share this with your local community, every vote counts :-)

Best wishes,

Koen
