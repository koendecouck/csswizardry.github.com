You'll notice that the upcoming talks interface doesn't look like the original design from last week. I had to rush this first development build in order to meet a course related milestone requirement. No doubt this is why developers drink so much coffee.

It's remarkable how much of user experience is already latently submerged in the development process. I keep thinking 'what would the user do?', when faced with minor issues I forgot to test in the research or design phase. It forces me to periodically step back and try it out on a third party. User centered design really is an ongoing process.

<div>Now that I have this first build ready, it's time for a little usability feedback.  <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I purchased and re-read the revised version of Steve Krug's </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">Don't Make Me Think</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> which has a fantastic chapter called </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://sensible.com/downloads/DMMTchapter09_for_personal_use_only.pdf">Usability testing on 10 cents a day</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. I had read an earlier version of the book as a leisure reading last year. Here and now I was interested in getting Krug's perspective on mobile design and testing which is more prominently featured in the third revision of Don't Make Me Think. God I love that book.</span>
<div>I also relied on some of the suggestions <a href="https://plus.google.com/102534244683850398101" target="_blank" data-gapiscan="true" data-onload="true" data-gapiattached="true">+Michael Margolis</a> put forth in his <a href="https://plus.google.com/114082129627545059603" target="_blank" data-gapiscan="true" data-onload="true" data-gapiattached="true">+Google Ventures</a> Startup Lab workshop: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpzmOH0hrEM">User Research, Quick 'n' Dirty</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Even when I've found myself in situations where I'm predominantly focusing on the development of projects, I've found it helpful to step back at times and approach problems from a user research perspective. I'm sure it will contribute to the value of my final wrap-up. Two weeks left on the clock.</div>
