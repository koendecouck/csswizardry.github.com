Doing field research in international settings can be challenging and costly. In this blog post I touch upon a couple of aspects specifically about doing fieldwork abroad. This is by no means intended to be full overview, more like a reflection on some of this topic's literature complemented with some personal anecdotes.

Doing product research properly will take time. A lot of time. Generally it will take a lot more time than management initially suspects. It doesn't help that a UX researcher is often still fighting for his/her 'raison d'etre' in the company (his reason of being). When a strong sense of what the product ought to be already permeates the company, it can be hard to go against the flow.
The reason field research takes time has a couple of reasons. There may be some barriers in place that limit your productivity: mostly language or cultural related. Unless you've lived in that country it will take time to get acquainted with social cues and nuances that may be relevant to your product. You might be hearing users in interviews, but not know how to properly listen to everything they are telling you.
In the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Global-UX-Design-Research-Connected/dp/012378591X">Global UX - Design and research in a connected world</a>, Jhilmil Jaim talks about his company expansion into the educational market for Brazil and Asia. It took them over a year of research. That was already extraordinary to me. In my experience no company will hand out that much time for user research, not unless they really see the value of it. I suspect Jaim worked for a bigger multinational, a company that can afford working that kind of time scale. My own experience as a UX researcher involved constant time pressure, the need for rapid results. In the end you always wish you could go back just to double-check on follow-up on something you didn't have time for.
<ul>- <strong>Immediate needs:</strong> functional/aesthetic changes</ul>
<ul>- <strong>Short term:</strong> Needs of this user base (how do they differ from our home market?)</ul>
<ul>- <strong>Long term:</strong> What new technologies are there for the company to move into?</ul>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesmhudson">Jim Hudson (Paypal)</a> offered an interesting opinion on international field work: if possible don't pick only English speaking countries. These countries already share the same, broad cultural basis. Instead seek out different attitudes, different payment methods. If your product can deal with those it can survive anywhere.
I like that idea, it makes sense for global products. I'm almost tempted to replace 'product' with 'you'. Doing user research in a foreign country really tests your ability as a researcher. When you bother to properly immerse yourself, it will likely change you personally. You'll come out of it with a wider perspective and fresh ideas about doing things. 

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/techniques-invasiveness-present.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/techniques-invasiveness-present.png" alt="techniques-invasiveness-present" width="497" height="321" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4712" /></a>

How about this for example? Rachel Hinman notes these techniques as '<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Rachel_Hinman/mobile-ux-essentials-6643654">mobile UX essentials</a>'. She tells us she always tries to cover 2 or 3 squares of this diagram to get the full picture. The underlying point here being that simply by being present the researcher is changing the behavior he/she is trying to observe. Rachel doesn't point this out specifically, but what she is referring to is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne effect</a>. The effect is even larger when the researcher is perceived as a foreign party, eliciting less feedback from the user and biasing some the behavior. It can be minimized by making the participant feel at ease and offering a few cultural cues that establish yourself as an in-group member, or at least someone who is culturally familiar with the participant's world.

<strong>Screen sharing</strong>
If you do want to minimize researcher presence (or simply looking to cut costs), screen sharing offers a good solution. A lot of UX research techniques can be modified to work in online screen sharing environment. Card sorting for example is getting very popular to do over the web. Most of the time you will have to do at least some aspects of the work face-to-face. Though personally, I feel that is mainly a technological limitation at this point that could be solved through better software.
I like to still be present for user sessions, just because it's easier to adapt to unforeseen distractions, control the environment and pick up on user's body language while we're talking about the product. I've had cases where screen sharing however was used because of distance reasons, e.g. during the <a href="http://koendecouck.com/?portfolio=google-cloud-usability-study">Google Cloud project</a>, where we had to talk to developer folks working in San Francisco, on the other side of the West Coast. Screen sharing is pretty reliable technology inside the USA, where high bandwidth speeds are common. When we were working with local users on a  <a href="http://koendecouck.com/?portfolio=parliament-interactive-data-visualization">parliament visualization for India</a>, screen sharing was more troublesome because of connection issues in India. Ergo, depending on what country you are working with screen sharing might be more or less appropriate.

A quick note on screen sharing software. I have found some of the most popular tools right now to be  <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html">Camtasia</a> (Windows, Mac) and <a href="http://silverbackapp.com/">Silverback</a> (Mac). I used Camtasia back in the day while working on the <a href="http://koendecouck.com/?portfolio=google-cloud-usability-study">Google Cloud project</a>. I was quite satisfied with its performance. However my problem with all of these solutions is that they give the finger to the minority of UX professionals that do their heavy power lifting on Linux. Right now I'm still looking out for good Linux solutions. <a href="http://quickscreenshare.com/">Quick Screen share</a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) and <a href="https://www.mikogo.com/">Mikogo</a> (Windows, Mac, Linux) both seem decent options. The first one is pretty basic, but free to use. I haven't tried them yet though.
Also if you're looking for plain and simple screen recording, I can recommend the popular <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC player</a> which comes with a screen recording 'streaming' option straight off the bat. Totally free and works across platforms.

Something I really like about screen sharing tools is their potential to involve other members from outside the research team. 'Global UX' mentions this application, saying it can be ideal for remote sessions to enable others to observe. Basically, screen sharing can replace what was traditionally done through (expensive) one-way mirrors and camera's. "There is something about knowing that the session is going on right now that makes it more compelling.", dixit Jhumkee Iyengar. I agree, I think a live link to user research sessions have great potential. They have a certain Big Brother appeal to it. It also gives engineers and management a chance to socially organize around the event: inviting others to come watch tv together from the sofas and observe the session. The learning takes place in an environment that maximally comfortable for all parties involved. The user doesn't feel crowded or watched, the researcher is allowed to focus and the rest of the team can enjoy and discuss the session in any environment they prefer.

<strong>After thought</strong>
In my experience however, international field work often gets outsourced to local, specialized research companies to do the research for you. The benefit there is that you're working with native speakers, so the research is likely to be of higher quality than what you might have been able to find as team of foreigners. I've led a Belgian research start-up based on this business model, I can testify to how popular those services are to companies. More specifically we're talking about small to mid-range companies. Larger multinationals like Google and Microsoft often have their own local offices doing research into those markets. Most of it is localized sales and marketing however. I recall a Belgian job fair in Ghent three years ago, with two Belgian Microsoft employees presenting. After the talk I remember walking up to them and asking them about their user experience teams, specifically user research and the engineering divisions of Microsoft in Belgium. I was quite surprised when they told me the local office only dealt in sales. In other words plenty of business majors but no user researchers or engineers around. As a windows user (this was before I made the change to Linux) this really rubbed me the wrong way. You'd take our money, but not our thoughts on what might make the product better? Who better to ask what Belgian users want than us local people ourselves?
