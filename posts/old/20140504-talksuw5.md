The picture says it all: this week I've been learning how to use <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. I need it to deploy talks.uw 1.0. Typically learning something as complex as Ruby (or Rails. let alone the two together) takes somewhere between 2-6 months to learn. Similarly I've read that the learning curve can be quite steep. I'm trying to pick it up with only 4 weeks left on the clock. Crazy, I know. I enjoy crazy.

It can be hard at times though.

... And I needed to try a few times.

But Â I succeeded. My first Ruby on rails application is now up and running, with full back-end database support from the University of Washington server. Not bad for a kid who didn't know anything about Ruby only a few days ago, right?
