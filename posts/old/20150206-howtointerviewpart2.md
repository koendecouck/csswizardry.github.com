Before reading this, check out the <a href="http://koendecouck.com/how-to-interview/">general interview guidelines of 'How to interview'</a>. Assuming you read it, you are now in the right mindset to take the interview. But how about content? What will you say? This post is intended as a jump-off platform with names and hyperlinks to accelerate the homework.
Note: I made an earlier version of this post originally to get it me through a phone interview at Google. It worked wonders, so I decided to expand on it here and share.

<strong>Principles</strong>
<a href="http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/what-is-the-minimum-effective-dose-my-tim-ferriss-obsession-confession"><strong>Minimum effective dose</strong></a> (cf. Tim Ferris)
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/deconstruct-the-skills-you-want-to-learn-to-make-learni-504472629"><strong>Deconstruct, reassemble and learn</strong></a> (cf. Tim Ferris)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain"><strong>Neuron in a global brain</strong></a>. Forward info, help incoming request, help others network. You have limited input/output potential, so be selective in your networking. Don't have your life focus be yourself.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_No_Trace"><strong>Leave no trace</strong></a>. Blend in wherever you go. It also means minimal possessions as a nomad who leaves no trace.
<strong>Blend in, until you're asked to stand out.</strong> Storytelling demands you to be larger than life (individualistic). Life demands you to be blend in (Group-oriented). Have your brand's identity sober but flexible enough to switch as required.
<strong>Be your brand</strong>. Learn what a brand is, what people expect.
<strong>Time = Money</strong>. Imagine that you'd have to pay money throughout the day for everything you do. Pay to eat. Pay to read. Pay to watch tv. Would you be willing to pay for what you're doing? If not, then you probably shouldn't be doing it (and try cutting it out of your life).

When I need a function or piece of code I already wrote before, I grab it from a previous project. That saves some time.

<strong>Favorite project</strong>. <a href="http://koendecouck.com/portfolio/google-cloud-usability-study/">Google Cloud Platform</a>. I've pursued opportunities to continue to collaborate with Google in a more professional sense when possible. During winter quarter 2014 at UW I helped plan and conduct a usability study centered around the relational database solutions that are a part of the Google Cloud Platform. I worked on this project in collaboration with +Joe Tullio, a User Experience Researcher based out of Google's Fremont offices. I additionally worked closely on this project with Patrick Dugan and Monica Caraway (both graduate students in the department of Human Centered Design and Engineering at UW).
