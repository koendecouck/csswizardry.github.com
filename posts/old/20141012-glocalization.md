Here I want to look at the websites of a couple of big multinational brands, tailored to different countries. We will talk about localized design and see if these design elements correlate with results from different cultural research studies. I will point out several elements that are worthy to pay attention to when designing across cultures. Finally we will take a quick look at one multinational brand in particular that does almost the exact opposite: a globalized strategy with a global template. How does that work?

<strong>Global while local</strong>
Multinational companies go at great lengths to incorporate themselves into local cultures. In doing so they hope to establish a friendly, trustworthy identity for themselves that you would be comfortable buying from. At the same time these entities want to stay recognizable, even when you travel abroad, and create a unifying brand that is truly global. Globalization and localization need to be strategically balanced.

There are three basic approaches to managing a global brand online. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/welchmanpierpoint/three-web-governance-models-that-work">Lisa Welchman</a> (ActiveStandards) refers to three web governance models:
<ul><strong>- Empire. </strong>All control of the website, incl. design and content, is centralized in one group.</ul>
<ul><strong>- Confederation.</strong> Loose relationship between business units with little central control, and voluntary participation in web standards.</ul>
<ul><strong>- Federation.</strong> Business units work together to agree on how the web will be governed. The central group is given authority to manage shared resources.</ul>
Each has both benefits and drawbacks. As said most corporate entities will try to strike a balance between an empire model (global brand) and a federation (very different local sites). Let's now look at a few examples, analyzed through <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html">Hofstede's model of cultural dimensions</a>. I'm also relying on <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2254442">Gasparini, Pimenta & de Oliveira (2011)</a>, whose article translates a lot of these dimension scores into actionable design recommendations.

<strong>Site localization assessment</strong> 
<em>McDonalds - Power Distance - <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/kuwait.html">Kuwait (90)</a> vs <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/ireland.html">Ireland (28)</a></em>

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/11.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/11.png" alt="1" width="800" height="433" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4696" /></a>
Kuwait has a very unequal society. People in Kuwait accept a hierarchical order in which everybody has a place and which needs no further justification. Kuwait's high score on power distance ought to translate in a high user expectation for instructions, a high level of support and many navigational cues. The navigation is linear and highly structured.
Gasparini et al (2011) also recommends a low information density, especially limiting the information on the first level. That means few links and minimal navigation possibilities. This is certainly true for this example: the landing page is deliberately kept very simple. Even the menu bar itself retracts (something it doesn't do anymore once a user moves beyond the first level).

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/1b.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/1b.png" alt="1b" width="800" height="503" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4697" /></a>
Ireland's low power distance means they have a society that is more informal, direct and participative. In web design that means a non-linear navigation is preferred with lots of potential to explore. The website needs to provide different points of access and navigation possibilities. Notice the bottom banner already promoting other offers the users might be interested (unrelated info that would be perceived as very out of place by a Kuwait user). Also take note of the privacy notice at the top, which is required by law for websited in EU countries. European cultures are very concerned and protective of their citizens' right to online privacy.

<em>KFC - Masculinity - <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/austria.html">Austria (79)</a> vs <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/denmark.html">Denmark (16)</a></em>

This particular example is interesting because we are comparing to West-European societies on opposite sites of the scale. Too many foreign businesses still assume the West-European market is more or less homogeneous, being high GDP western societies. While things do seem to be evolving towards greater unity, much of the old European nations' history still lives on today in matters of culture.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/2a1.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/2a1.png" alt="2a" width="800" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4698" /></a>

At 79, Austria is a masculine society – highly success oriented and driven. In masculine countries, people “live in order to work”, managers are expected to be decisive, the emphasis is on equity, competition and performance. Gasparini translates this into design as a preference for bright, aggressive colors with high contrast. The navigation needs to be allow for decision making and explorative path finding. Graphics and art serve a more utilitarian purpose or may refer more to games and contests. This last point certainly is very prominent on KFC's site, where winners are announced directly on the landing page. Compare the very aggressive use of red for Austria with the Danish version below it.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/2b.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/2b.png" alt="2b" width="800" height="560" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4699" /></a>

Denmark scores 16 on this dimension and is therefore considered a feminine society. In feminine countries it is important to keep the life/work balance and you make sure that all are included. An effective manager is supportive to his/her people, and decision making is achieved through involvement. Managers strive for consensus and people value equality, solidarity and quality in their working lives. For design this means focusing on pastel colors with low saturation. The whole scenery needs to be aesthetically pleasing with whatever promotions there are focusing on relationships, exchange and support. The wooden surface offers that soft, natural feel. The prime real estate devoted to the KFC add is no coincidence: the add was well chosen to appeal to a feminine society sensitive to love, family and relationships.

<em>Wrigley - Long term orientation - <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/china.html">China (118)</a> vs <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/united-kingdom.html">UK (25)</a></em>

Longterm orientation is a new dimension in the model, based on what previously was called 'pragmatism' and 'indulgence'. The term is pretty self-explanatory. Long term orientation is typically stronger present in Asian societies than it is for countries from the Western world.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/3a.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/3a.png" alt="3a" width="800" height="551" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4700" /></a>

China is an example of a very long term oriented society. Relationships are established for life and carefully cultivated. Similarly companies have a very long term vision trying to win the hearts and minds of customers and to try establish a rapport. Openness of professional terms is very important, with all information given upfront as a sign of trust. For design this vision impacts the density of information: with a high score like this, chinese expect to see most information instantly at interface level. This results in high density information given the limited screen space. The action on screen also tends to be a little more lively.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/3b.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/3b.png" alt="3b" width="800" height="535" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4701" /></a>

The United Kingdom is an example of the other opposite, holding a low score on this trait. Normally this results in low information density and highly structured (everything is neatly packed away behind the appropriate menu option).

<strong>Site globalization assessment </strong>
Every year <a href="http://bytelevel.com/reportcard2014/">Byte Level Research LLC</a> releases its '<a href="http://bytelevel.com/reportcard2014/">Web Globalization Report Card</a>', ranking company websites on their effectiveness of creating a globalized online portal that remains consistent and highly recognizable. It also needs to be easy to use. The top 3 for 2014 came down to <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="www.hotels.com">hotels.com</a> and <a href="www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. From these I just want to take a quick look at Facebook, given its rather subtle localization features.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/4.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/4.png" alt="4" width="800" height="425" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4694" /></a>

The log-in screen of Facebook is a great example of a globalized template. It's basically just a simple translation, adjusted for reading direction (as we can tell from the Arabic version). The reason it works is because there is little or no visual content that could spark cultural differences: no photos, no animation. The color pallet is kept simple as well, with just a few primary colors. The only picture at log-in shows a world map, which could have been made to center on the relevant continent.

In fact, a few months ago users started noticing a very subtle localized feature. While the world picture at log-in stayed the same, the world <em>icon</em> did change depending on geographical location. 

<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/4b.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/4b.png" alt="4b" width="800" height="178" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4695" /></a>

This change had however nothing to do with the language version the user was using. Does this count as a localized design feature? Would it have been if it had been tight in to the language version of the user?
I love this little feature as it does away with what I called '<a href="http://koendecouck.com/?p=4677">cultures as flowerpots</a>' in my last post, where we assume cultures are static, bound to certain regions of the world, with limited interaction. This little feature acknowledges that users travel, and tailors itself to reflect that. It seems specifically designed with a connected world in mind.
