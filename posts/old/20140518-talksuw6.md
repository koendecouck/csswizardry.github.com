For this post I'm sharing some early design concept, in reverse chronological order.

<strong>Third iteration</strong>

<a href="/_post_images/2014/05/IMG_0806small.jpg"><img alt="IMG_0806(small)" src="/_post_images/2014/05/IMG_0806small.jpg" width="424" height="323" /></a>

The third iteration changes the landing page to once again show featured content. The search fields corners are again straight in accordance to the other elements on the page. The real estate space on the left is put to better use by hosting the client's twitter feed.  A twitter feed integrates nicely with this product, which after all aims to depict an active, vibrant community.

<strong>Second iteration</strong>

<a href="/_post_images/2014/05/IMG_0802small.jpg"><img alt="IMG_0802(small)" src="/_post_images/2014/05/IMG_0802small.jpg" width="398" height="300" /></a>

The second iteration eliminates the side menu in favor of just a top menu structure. I also researched the house style of my client (the University of Washington) and adjusted the design accordingly.
<ul>
	<li>two top menu's (one of which required by the house style)</li>
	<li>institution logo, in addition to the product name</li>
	<li>Dual search functionality (either by clicking 'search events' or the prominent green button')</li>
	<li>copyright footer</li>
</ul>
<strong>First iteration</strong>

<a href="/_post_images/2014/05/IMG_0798small.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4238" alt="IMG_0798(small)" src="/_post_images/2014/05/IMG_0798small.jpg" width="473" height="352" /></a>
<ul>
	<li>prominent logo</li>
	<li>accessible search bar</li>
	<li>featured content</li>
</ul>
There are two navigational items: a side menu on the left, and secondary menu on top.  I showed it to users and refined the design based on their feedback.
