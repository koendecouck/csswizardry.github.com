There are two kinds of interview: the <strong>job interview</strong>, and the <strong>reported interview</strong>. I am in no means a PR expert, but I am a hacker. I've found that both can be deconstructed to follow the same rules and thus an algorithm can be devised to deal with both. I'm sharing my notes here on how to hack any interview.

<strong>A little motivation</strong>
- You're awesome. That's why they want your story. (They don't just want to hear it, they want to OWN it!).
- Be your brand. Be your brand visually, but also mentally and ethically. Remember what your brand stands for. Learn what a brand is, what people expect from it.

- <strong>Use hard data</strong> to back up your claims. Research the subject before the interview, and share that information. Opinions are dirt, data is silver, processed data is gold.
- <strong>Name drop</strong> to demonstrate your network. Even if you're just on the receiving end of those people's content. Try to balance the name drops of 'following' and 'followers' to 50% each to demonstrate your input and output. 'Followers' are names of people you've interacted with and who can vow for you.
- <strong>Spice data with anecdote & observation.</strong> Tell trivial anecdotes and/or observations about the world as they relate to your story. They make good kindling.
- <strong>Show no weakness.</strong> Your audience needs you to be larger than life. A good interviewee tells the story his/her audience needs to hear. To serve your audience, show no weakness. You also could be dealing with a shark interviewer. These are shrewd, but nasty professionals looking to test your response in an exploitative way or just plain looking for blood. Show no weakness because the interviewer might magnify any imperfection in order to sell his own story rather than yours. If you're dealing with sharks your best bet is to stay calm, show no weakness, remove yourself from the situation and keep away from the shark in the future. It happens to everyone.
- <strong>Say 'NO'</strong> when you don't want to interview at all. Interviews are a really inefficient use of time, so only do them when the storytelling would be beneficial to you both. Your time is better spend being productive and coding awesome stuff that makes a difference. So say 'no' to media interviews when the outlet is of no interest to you. Say 'no' to job interviews when you feel they're just mass-mailing or not valuing your time. Another valid tactic is to delegate the interview to a trusted other.

- <strong>Do not teach.</strong> An interview is not about maximizing the transfer of information in a limited amount of time. An interviewer just wants to be told a good story, so he can then echo it to sell. 
- <strong>Do not present.</strong> An interview is not a presentation. Presentation and interview both contain storytelling as a vital skill, they both serve a larger audience and require similar flair of hard data mixed with anecdote. However presentations are one-way streets. Interviews have two-way traffic. Adapt to where the interviewer wants to take you. Take turns. You <em>must</em> take turns.
- <strong>Do not talk about yourself.</strong> Ironic, I know. But really, nobody actually wants you, they want the story of your brand. They want something <em>from</em> you. Help them out by telling the right story - your brand's story - and thus keeping the interview on track.
- <strong>Do not give free handouts.</strong> Don't give any tips/hacks/advice that's not already in a book/blog. Explicitly refer to your book/blog. Re-tell a story that's already there.
