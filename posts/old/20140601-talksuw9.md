Since I started on this 10-week challenge, I've received tons of positive feedback. Many people are interested both in my personal process, many want to know what the product can do for them. The next few days will be therefore be focused on communicating the results. Presentation of one's work is a crucial part of the process. Tomorrow I will present a 10 minute talk on talks.uw for a UX professional audience. Many of my instructors and peers will be there. Talks.uw has also been selected to participate in <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/open-house">HCDE Open House</a>, a large poster event with demo's from HCDE's most innovative projects.

Designing it has been a very personal journey (just like the other milestones for this project). It incorporates multiple visual elements and forced me to think about the science behind delivering a clear visual message. I deduced a couple of  'natural laws' from studying a number of what I considered very successful posters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Mimic the company style, font and color scheme</strong> (UW = purple, gold)</li>
	<li><strong>Mimic the product's own visual style</strong> (Logo, top banner and yellow magnifying glass are all elements from talks.uw which I over-emphasize here by increasing there relative size).</li>
	<li><strong>Create an inviting visual scene</strong>. Dutch painters call it a 'stilleven' [still-lay-von], a number of carefully arranged objects to make even a painting of a fruit basket interesting. In this case, I added a branch of cherry blossoms (iconic for UW's famous cherry trees) and put Fibonnacci's spiral as a geometric element that invites viewers to come investigate.</li>
	<li><strong>Control the visual gaze through structured elements. </strong>I rotated Fibonnaci's spiral to coincide with the dominant reading direction (left-to-right, top-to-bottom). A viewer can literally follow the line of the story without any need for dates or numbering.</li>
	<li><strong>Restrict the hues to only a few colors. </strong>To avoid complexity I deliberately altered the color balance of all visual elements (except for the product itself) to shades of purple. This creates a natural spotlight on the only object left that has color: the product. The gold of the magnifying glass creates a pop-out effect that entices users to look at the QR code and try the product out themselves.</li>
	<li><strong>QR codes. </strong>If your product is online, then put up a link for people to check it out! QR codes take advantage of the pervasive ownership of smartphones. Strangely enough I never see people sharing QR codes on their poster.</li>
	<li><strong>Everything is connected.</strong> A good poster is a single entity supported by its elements. Many of the posters I've seen look like too much like mosaics, with irrelevant features that don't fit the whole. That's like talking to the guy next to you while being distracted by his big nose. Even the decoration elements should adhere to the color scheme and have some kind of connection to the message. In this poster, the bottom landscape subconsciously supports the idea that this is a product for the whole campus. It also ties in with the purple spheres resembling a lunar period or a mild sunset. The Fibonacci spiral ties all these elements together, serves as a 'desk' through a few deliberate straight lines and emphasizes the word 'talks' from the sub heading.</li>
</ul>

I'm proud of how far I've come in graphic design, all of it through the act of scientific observation and analytic thought. I have yet to take my first graphic design class.

A personal friend of mine, <a href="http://dub.washington.edu/people/susan-oldham">Susan Oldham</a>, is an amazing graphic designer with many years of experience. When I asked her for a few tips she shared one of her own ways of gathering inspiration: going for a walk in the <a href="http://www.caup.washington.edu/">College of Built environments</a>. She goes there to look at all the posters made by the students in architecture.

I took her suggestion and documented my walk there. In one of the posters I encountered Fibonnaci's spiral which directly inspired my own design. Among the other posters I also encountered a small origami structure which lead me to a new textual data visualization technique. The different paragraphs (triangles) thereby combine together to reflect the overall argument and text structure. But that's a story for another day.

Many different styles are represented in this collection, with influences from all across the world. I found myself particularly attracted to the Munchen poster for the summer games of 1972 (left). Adopting a Seattle banner, with a purple sky as a background was partially inspired by this famous piece.
