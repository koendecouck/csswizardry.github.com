Interviews are done. I talked to 8 people from different backgrounds (faculty staff, PhD students, master students), from different UW departments. I originally thought of doing about 10-15 interviews (recommended by academic authors like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/A-Practical-Guide-Usability-Testing/dp/1841500208">Dumas &amp; Redish</a>), however I quickly noticed that each of my respondents more or less reported the same issues. After respondent #8 I felt I had reached a saturation point.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/04/00.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4170" alt="00" src="/_post_images/2014/04/00-300x97.jpg" width="300" height="97" /></a>I got a lot of good feedback from these interviews. People really liked the non-invasive style of interviewing: over lunch for example or while waiting for a bus. One person called it '<strong>guerilla style interviews</strong>', and smiled. Despite the impression of casualness though, interviews were semi-structured in nature. Each time I went in with certain key questions, but I let people tell me the answer through their own story. One respondent was telling how he enjoyed the free food at some of these talks, before reflecting on how awesome it would be if that information was included on the talks' website. Another respondent was reminded of a calendar project he once tried to set up for his department, and volunteered to show me the email threat. Even though interviews were only meant to last a few minutes, many participants enjoyed the conversation style so much that they didn't mind volunteering more time. In that case the conversation grew naturally from the core issues I originally aimed to address. It resulted in a very rich, qualitative data set.

Next, I will isolate the different points participants brought up and put that in a more structured <strong>focus group</strong> format. This measure is designed to further differentiate important features from add-ons. The interviews themselves already revealed a lot about that, but in that case participants never had a full feature overview. Other people might like the idea of having a 'free food' notice for example. I aim to keep that as a short first-half of the session. It's useful and gets participants warmed up. For the second part of the session we'll look at <em>talks.cam</em>, a comparable product by the University of Cambridge. Based on participant feedback I'll then design a the first iteration prototype of <em>talks.uw.</em>

While I'm busy doing that, a more <strong>quantitative survey</strong> will collect additional responses from students and staff across campus. Interviews are nice, but I like hard numbers. It will will allow me to paint a campus-wide picture and add a few nice metrics and data visualizations to the client report. Some people are more data-driven, some are more visually inclined. This caters to their tastes. <a href="/_post_images/2014/04/0.jpg"><img class="alignleft" alt="0" src="/_post_images/2014/04/0-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a><em>(Note: One interesting work that mentions this is 'Mental martial arts' by BBC interviewer Brain Sterling-Vete, I had the opportunity to meet Brian this week and pick his thoughts on this, as part of his new book).</em>

<em></em>Next week's deliverable is a user research report, combining all that info. I'll discuss some of the finding in my next post. After that, It'll be time to jump into designing!
