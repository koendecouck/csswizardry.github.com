Last night I tweeted something pretty odd:

As expected most people scratched their heads at this. My euforia was lost on them. I had just solved an design problem that had been bothering me for months. Like a splinter in my brain. Although the splinter itself was so deep that it cut through multiple knowledge fields for me: from design to the depths of existential philosophy.

It all started with just one question: what property makes you unique? This wasn't merely a matter of philosophical pondering, there are real-world applications to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identifier">personal identifiers</a>. Names, social security numbers, birth days, pin codes. All different identification systems putting their mark on 'who you are' within the system. Their properties are supposed to make them unique.
There is also a significant psychological factor involved. People develop <a href="http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/john-yeager/2007021090">strong emotional bonds to their names</a> or the sequence of numbers that spell their date of birth. Many will look to fashion or accessories to build a visual identity that distinguishes them from others.

The actual story begins in May 2014, when I attended a public UX workshop, given by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickfinck">Nick Finck</a>. Nick is a user experience author and lecturer who came to talk to us about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/nickf/ux-career-progression-finding-a-niche-and-building-a-personal-brand-1">building a personal brand</a>. 

<a href="/_post_images/2014/09/finck1.jpg"><img src="/_post_images/2014/09/finck1.jpg" alt="finck1" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4619" /></a>
Nick talked about the importance of establishing a personal color scheme, or deliberating introducing an unusual feature that assists personal identification. It accommodates our brain's static notion of identity. Ever noticed how mascots or cartoon characters never seem to change their outfit? 

<a href="/_post_images/2014/09/sus.jpg"><img src="/_post_images/2014/09/sus.jpg" alt="sus" width="800" height="256" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4621" /></a>
Willy and Wanda (Dutch: Suske and Wiske) is a Belgian comic book series that's almost a century old since it first hit the presses. In all that time the visual identity of the characters has hardly changed at all. With the comic's rising popularity, the colors have become deeply associated with the characters themselves. The same trick is used when people transform their complex selves in their own personal 'brand'.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/09/finck2.jpg"><img src="/_post_images/2014/09/finck2.jpg" alt="finck2" width="800" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4622" /></a>
Consistency is very important. The trick is build on our brain's tendency to find links in different co-occuring variables. It needs consistent repeated exposure to work. (I sort of deduced this myself, given what I knew of neuropsychology. Nick has a cinematography background: he saw the effect, but not its cause).

The talk got me thinking: is there a particular color I identify with? A new kind of puzzle was introduced to me that proved impossible to ignore. Not until I had solved it. While the rationale was sound, I found Nick's examples to a large extent unsatisfying. How would red glasses or dyeing my hair purple be in any way related to me? The connection was arbitrary, not to mention a little flamboyant for my taste. Many probably wrote it off as a hipster designer thing.

But building a unique personal identity (or 'brand') is as much an engineering problem as anything else. It has its problems. Having 'red glasses' as your brand may fail for the same reason your name or birthday are flawed identifiers: someone else might have the same glasses/name/birthday. Not to mention your name and birthday also were arbitrarily assigned at birth. Your social security number is an arbitrary number assigned to you by the federal government. Other nations have totally different social security number formats. Finally, other entities will assign you different unique identifiers for each purpose: a cellphone number, a bank account. Your cell number is actually a better identifier than your name is.

<p align="center">There has to be a better way.</p>

<strong>Color</strong>
A solution ultimately came to me after a talk with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_C._Stone">dr. Maureen Stone</a>, one of the world's experts on color modelling. The number of colors in existence is essentially limitless, solely constrained by the properties of the human eye and our brain's ability to perceive them. You could theoretically assign every human on Earth a unique color 'branding' code. However, humans can only distinguish between roughly 10 million different colors. Not to mention we lack names for all of those.
That last part we can remedy. In the technology sector colors are typically specified either as an RGB triplet or in hexadecimal format (a hex triplet). Both have a six character format, e.g. #123456. Those characters can be either digits (0-9) or letters (A-F). Therefore, the total possible number of hex colors equals 16,777,216 (256 to the third power).

So there, you could have almost 17 million people dyeing their hair as a personal branding strategy before you're expected to run out. Not a perfect solution, given that there are 314 million people living in the US alone. But it will do for now.

<strong>What color am I?</strong>
You could always pick a random color and appropriate it: your favorite color for example. But preferences change for time through random associations. Is that color really 'you'?
In contrast, there are colors that have been with you since birth. Your natural hair color for example, although for many people that too changes during childhood. There is skin color. While that does constitute the dominant color of your body, it does not allow enough variations in hue to distinguish on a personal level.
The color of the iris seems the best choice: it is an integral part of you and relatively fixed over time. It has a large range of hues, considering that iris color is actually a composite of many different hues blended together. Eye color therefore seems like the most natural place to start from. Now we have to establish a color scheme.

<strong>Establish your own personal color id</strong>
You probably already have an idea what color your eyes are. We will however need a little bit more. Photograph your eye at close range (Make sure the flash is turned off!). A high resolution shot is preferable as it will give you more options to work with.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/09/eye.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/09/eye.png" alt="eye" width="800" height="294" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4625" /></a>

Color is often mistaken as a property of light when it really is a property of the brain. Our experience of color depends not only on the wavelength of the light rays that hit the retina, but also the context in which we perceive it- things such as background colors, lighting, familiarity, and surroundings. Up to now I always thought my eyes were green. Turns out they are more greyish, with an inner circle of brown. You can tell the difference much better by putting the color directly against the background of the iris.
Experiment by sampling different areas of the iris until you find a shade you like. I used the Google code project <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gpick/">gpick</a> to identify and manipulate the corresponding hex values.

Ideally the shade you pick should be <a href="http://www.workwithcolor.com/color-properties-definitions-0101.htm">fully saturated (pure color)</a>, and preferably <a href="http://www.workwithcolor.com/color-properties-definitions-0101.htm">fully illuminated</a>. For me this presented a dilemma since the original grey of my eyes is a lowly saturated color. When I artificially increased the saturation, I discovered for the first time in my life that they were actually brown/yellowish when you force the color to come out.

However I wanted to preserve the original color as much as possible. I found the predominant grey of my eyes (as I perceived it) and wrote down its hex code.

<strong>Using your eye color as a web color</strong>
In his talk, Nick Finck mentioned the importance of color consistency across platforms. If you maintain an online presence this has some very strong implications on which colors are appropriate. These implications have to do with fashion to a large extend, but I know some designers who can get pretty worked up about it.

Basic rules:
- Only use bright, fully saturated colors online. 
- Preserve readability of your site.
- Consider the cultural associations of some colors.
 
The bright, fully saturated version of my eye color was a kind of green-yellow-brown, depending of which grey I took as the base. The green had a strong connotation of sickness around it, which made it inappropriate. Yellow provided a horribly low contrast against white backgrounds. Brown seemed too ordinary. I decided on a kind of fully saturated teal.

<strong>Using eye color as a guide to clothing style</strong>
I don't want to wear glasses all the time, nor do I want to be dyeing my hair teal for the rest of my life. So what do I do? I decided to take my personalized color as a guide to clothing in general: shirts, pants, shoes. My base color is a kind of grey teal that still allows for a wide range of greys and greens that I'm comfortable with. I like the kind of camouflaged look it gives me. Some variation is necessary given people's tendency to wear bright lively colors in spring and summer, versus darker shades in autumn and winter. I've been taking care to adapt saturation and brightness in response to my environment without changing color hue. Yes, I only wear teal now!

<strong>Using eye color as a number</strong>
Now that you have determined your own personalized color, you automatically have a unique hex value. That number could be used to replace any other personal identifier. While it might be too eccentric as a name (wouldn't that be interesting though!), it could serve perfectly well as a custom phone number for example.
<a href="https://www.google.com/voice">Google Voice</a> is an awesome service that lets you pick your own number for free. Google will then forward the calls and texts from that number to your old phone. It also lets you text for free, read sms on your pc and make cheap international calls!

Your hex only has 6 characters, while a US phone number has 10. That gives you some options. I wrote a script to gather and compare those options and select the ones that had some kind of mnemonic device to them. I found the perfect one: easy to memorize, and as a bonus the different block permutations of six all give nice shades of teal/green.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
The problem of personal branding can be solved in a far more satisfying way than spraying purple hair. Not exactly unique, given our own human limitations, but as close as you can get with color-based codes. Besides, how many people can tell you their phone number, just by looking in your eyes? Ain't that awesome?
