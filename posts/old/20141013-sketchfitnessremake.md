A quick sketch, made while commuting to work today.

The following is a passing idea for a Japanese remake for iFitness, a US-based fitness app for iOS. The original language is English, and it's overall personality is very goal-oriented, practical and serious (as is the general habit for the US market).

Suppose now that we would be in charge of implementing this product in Japan. Not an easy task mind you, given the pretty wide cultural differences of the USA as compared to Japan. When you compare the two using <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/japan.html">Hofstede's cultural model</a>, you see the two are about as opposite and alien to each other as you can get:

<strong>Difficulty of this adaptation</strong>
There are many roadblocks in designing for the Japanese market:
<ul>
- <strong>Translation:</strong> You may be hard-pressed to find English speakers that are bilingual in Japanese. Also many words or concepts do not literally translated to something that holds the same connotation: 'fitness' is very Western concept. You run into more translation trouble once you try translation exercise names like 'abdominal reverse curl' and 'barbell cable rollout'. The direct translation sounds forced or confusing.</ul>
<ul>
- <strong>Reading direction:</strong> Japanese generally read from right to left. Text in apps will generally by right aligned (instead of left aligned for English). Menu options will need to mirrored. Images might need to be mirrored as well. Notice how the 'back' button switched from the left side to the right.</ul>
<ul>
- <strong>The cultural connotations surrounding happiness:</strong> Japanese have been socialized to a culture of lighthearted mascots with a high cuteness factor. These mascots can be compared to the western use of emoticons and rage faces (memes). People project actions and emotions onto these characters, often enlarged compared to daily life. Western cultures are less familiar with this infatuation. Ideally the app would have more than one character, to exploit consumers' tendency to bond with the 'chosen' character. The same way one would do with a pet.</ul>
<ul>
- <strong>Practical design concepts:</strong> Japanese culture scores very high on the dimension on masculinity. That translates to a color base with strong primary colors and high saturation (e.g. in the picture on the left). Compare this to the original, more neutral shots of the US version. I would probably redo the menu bar as well into something more colorful (a design choice also hinted to because of a low individualism score). As the society is more group-based the focus of fitness shifts from individual exercises to group workouts. I'd therefor have multiple mascots doing the same exercise in the background (e.g. left picture). The chosen mascot however would take center stage. Japan's high uncertainty avoidance merits the use of a simple interface, with limited choices. Keep it simple with just a list of exercises and the basic functionality users need and love.</ul>
