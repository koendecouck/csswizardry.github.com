Today is the first of a new mini-series of blog posts I'll be dedicating to <strong>international user experience</strong>. This is directly related to a fall class I'm taking which is unsurprisingly called... international user experience. For this post I will be applying Hofstede's dimensional model to illustrate a cultural comparison between US users and the Belgians. I will show how Belgium can be your gateway to the European market, and what makes it an ideal testing ground for user research.

Too few students realize the importance of internationalizing and localizing. I believe it to be one of the most profound sociological changes of our time: people and products move across national boundaries. The world is slowly coming together. Modern companies often ship their products to more than just one market. If the company is large enough they might have holdings in many different countries. In that kind of environment, international experience is a strong asset. But only when you know how to apply it.

For this post I'll be discussing a case study of two markets I'm familiar with: the United States and Belgium. Although I could widen this comparison to other countries I have lived in, I feel a deep comparison really requires native experience. I also believe Belgium makes for a particularly powerful example. See, as a business thinking of branching into Europe, you might be more interested in the larger markets: Britain, France, Germany.

Such a straightforward tactic often leads to critical mistakes. You didn't do your homework, you failed to understand local culture.

What you should be caring about is what the smaller countries think of you. Belgium, Luxembourg or the Czech Republic all make good choices. Why? <em>Rapid iterative user testing in smaller markets.</em>

<strong>Belgian guinea pigs</strong>
If it stinks, it sinks. Belgians will be able to point out the things that simply don't work in a European climate. With a smaller market user research in Belgium will go faster, easier and at a lower cost (less territory to cover). Big brands like <a href="https://cocacolabelgium.be/">Coca-Cola</a> discovered this years ago, which turned Belgium into a major hub for European market R&D. The Belgian government isn't shy about pointing out other potential benefits in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDH553Gml_o">business promotion video</a>.

Let me give you the fast version. The most important benefits are:
<li> Knowledge of English is common (even with older folks)</li>
<li>Excellent connections by plane to all major cities of the world</li>
<li>Strategic location in Europe. You'll be in Paris, Amsterdam, London or Berlin in minutes.</li>
<li>The port of Antwerp, second biggest in Europe, makes shipping products quick and easy.</li>
<li>It's the heart of political EU decision making. Convenient to keep taps of what lives in the EU.</li>
<li>The different language communities of Dutch, French and German speakers give you a preview of the continent as a whole. It's essentially Europe in a snowglobe: a miniature model to try things out.</li></p>
Let's look at some of the cultural differences.

<strong>Culture</strong>
<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/hofstede.png"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/hofstede.png" alt="hofstede" width="800" height="484" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4659" /></a>

Geert Hofstede is a Dutch social psychologist whose theories have been widely cited in cultural research. His <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/">website</a> allows you to generate similar cultural comparisons to the one above. One of the biggest mistakes your company can make is assuming that Western cultures can't really be that different. Western culture does create certain similarities ('individualism', 'masculinity', 'indulgence'). However note the differences above in what Hofstede calls 'power distance', 'uncertainty avoidance' and 'pragmatism'.

These things will impact your professional practice in Belgium. Here is where native experience comes in, the things I noticed as a Belgian working in the US. Let me turn that around to give you a look from the outside-in.

<strong>Power distance in Belgium</strong>
In America we prefer to maintain a casual, informal atmosphere as a way of generating ideas and promoting democratic input from workers. Belgians however quickly become uncomfortable in situations where the social hierarchy is violated. To them this kind of casual atmosphere comes across as almost artificial. You can't be friends with someone who can fire you from your job at a moment's notice. Expect them to agree to everything you say (or say nothing at all, just to be safe) while being scared out of their wits that you even invited them.

When doing user research this attitude might particularly get in your way, as Belgian users will have been strongly conditioned to regard you as the 'professional' who knows best. They will agree with whatever you seem to suggest as the interviewer and be very self conscious.

Social interactions in Belgium happen mostly among peers of similar social standing. Belgian relationships are very warm and loyal, but newcomers have to work hard to get accepted into that inner circle. It is not uncommon to be hanging out with high school friends years after finishing college or being employed. I suspect this power distance has something to do with Europe's aristocratic tradition and its many centuries of being a feudal society. This is very different from the settler spirit that was long prevalent in America, where literally everyone had to get his hands dirty.

<strong>Uncertainty avoidance in Belgium</strong>
Clinging to the familiar does not only show in who one chooses to spend time with. <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:e9xkyzcmwZQJ:deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/140924_belgium-job-hopping+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">A recent news survey</a> shows the vast majority of Belgians prefers to stay at the same job their whole lives. Job hopping is uncommon: Belgians are extremely loyal employees. This is rooted in a strong avoidance of uncertainty and risk: they keep their jobs, rarely move too far from their home village (all their high school friend are there) and limit their travelling to national holidays.
There is a strong tradition of health care, labor laws, insurance with high taxes to safeguard against more of life's risks. Consider this the angle your product will need to look on. Your company will need to show itself to be a respectable safe heaven that most of all cares about its users and workers.

<strong>Pragmatism in Belgium</strong>
Hofstede labels this dimension as a believe that truth depends very much on situation, context and time. Belgium is collection of different peoples speaking different languages and fostering different cultures. Because of that, they have long since adopted a very contextual point of view. Everything might be true when seen in a certain light. Few Belgians would be able to tell you exactly what 'being Belgian' is. Instead people will define themselves through a myriad of local affiliations and smaller cultural identities. There is far weaker sense of historical or national significance than an American would be used to, instead people relate more to simple pleasures. They appreciate experiences with the brands they like or the ones their friends of family have formed connections with.

All this is an application of Hofstede's model. A full explanation of Hofstede's dimensions may be found on his <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/">website</a>. When you check against the surrounding powers like France or Germany, you will find a great deal of cultural similarities. This is what makes this little country an ideal petri dish for taking your first steps into the European market.

For my next post, I'll be giving more concrete examples of US-EU differences in user experience, and how those differences are formed.
