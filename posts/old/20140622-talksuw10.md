<b>Talks.uw</b> is a proposed online calendar platform that shows all talks happening around UW campus. In addition to the main calendar it offers advanced search functionality, with info accessible by title, speaker, series, department, theme or any combination of these parameters. Talks.uw makes finding or communicating speaker events a lot easier. It is designed to incorporate the current system of email, with subscription links to relevant email lists. It expands on that system by featured content, list view,  calendar views and Google Maps integration. UW netID verification makes the system as secure as any other UW site. Future updates include a talks.uw calendar plugin for department websites, and the opportunity to download individual talks to your personal calendar. By creating greater visibility of all talks happening on campus, talks.uw hopes to cultivate the exchange of ideas both on campus and within UW’s wider community.

<b>What I did</b>

<a href="/_post_images/2014/06/10258094_10152857525144018_1494712969356357780_o.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4281" alt="10258094_10152857525144018_1494712969356357780_o" src="/_post_images/2014/06/10258094_10152857525144018_1494712969356357780_o-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>As part of my 10-week capstone project, I researched how talks are currently communicated at the University of Washington. I met with all parties involved and designed and developed an appropriate, user-centered solution. The final report on that system, called ‘<b>Talks.UW</b>’, can be viewed <a href="/_post_images/2014/06/593-Final-report.pdf">here</a>.<a href="/_post_images/2014/06/593-Final-report.pdf">

<ul>
	<li><b>Research</b>. I conducted a user study on campus, asking graduate students and staff about the mechanisms they use for finding out about talks.  I gathered responses through  individual semi-structured interviews, followed by a campus-wide survey. Results show the UW community is very engaged in intellectual debate, however researchers are generally unfamiliar with talks happening outside the department. The present system, department email, is prone to cause information overload. More information: <b><a href="/_post_images/2014/06/research-presentation.pdf">User research presentation</a></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Design</b>. I designed a number of low fidelity prototypes, with iterative user testing. This user feedback allowed for a continuous refinement of the prototype. This process accumulated into a high fidelity online prototype.

</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Development</b>. The talks.uw system was developed specifically for a native UW server environment. The final version was released in May 2014. Preliminary usability testing showed high user satisfaction, with some ideas for future updates.

<b>Current status</b>

Submitted as an implementation proposal to the office of the President and UW IT services (06-2014). UW IT staff were very excited to receive it!

<b>Final thoughts</b>

Talks.uw was hard work, but also a very rewarding experience! Working through the full R&amp;D process gave me a better idea of the full development process in companies. By living through it myself, I now better understand the different sensitivities of researchers, designers and developers. That may help me understand my own role or in a future management position leading a team of different skill sets.

People ask me whether this experience has given me a new insight into the job market. Traditionally it's a big decision whether to apply for start-ups that need this kind of broad skill set, or a more established company looking for specialists. If anything, this project has made me see the attraction of both. I took this opportunity to stretch myself in other areas (start-up), but I want to be fully emerged with the experience that perhaps only a specialist position will be able to provide. I guess it will come down to the intellectual stimulation in the environment, and my conviction for the company's mission. Perhaps it's time to look beyond limiting job labels.

I put in a lot of work on this, because I believed in talks.uw's capacity to make peoples lives better. It was the user-centered design process however that made it all possible: by involving the client from the start on, and never losing sight of the users. I continuously went back and forth: trying out new designs, or just asking questions. Which makes for a happy ending to this story: a high grade, lots of professional interest and usability tests showing users that were truly satisfied.
