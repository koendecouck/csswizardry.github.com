This week I want to respond to a chapter from a book I've been reading, entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Global-UX-Design-Research-Connected/dp/012378591X">Global UX: Design and Research in a Connected World</a> (2011). In it the authors discuss the idea of a 'global brand', yet provide very few concrete recommendations on how a 'global brand' can be realized. I refer to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization">ISO standards</a> and ask myself why the book doesn't even mention these. I also counter the implied notion that localization is always inherently good or desirable for your brand. I stand by this quote from Jim Neiters (employed by Yahoo!) who says: "Don't change unless you have data that the global template doesn't work". I would summarize my own view as follows: <em>don't just copy, but aim to set a higher standard.</em>
<a href="/_post_images/2014/10/global1.jpg"><img src="/_post_images/2014/10/global1.jpg" alt="global1" width="800" height="391" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4678" /></a>

Quesenbery & Szuc (2011) discuss three basic approaches to managing a global brand:
<li><strong>One product</strong>. The product is designed for a home market and sold globally with only minor localization</li>
<li><strong>Local control</strong>. Although all part of a global brand, each product is really a franchise in its own market, and makes its own design decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Global templates with local variations</strong>. A global UX group creates and manages a set of templates that both set a global standard and allow for local adaptations.</li>

This 'home market' has traditionally been the United States, for a long time the lead innovator in the IT industry. Many products are still designed by and for US citizens and shipped to other parts of the world with localization solely as an afterthought. Quesenbery & Szuc are right to reject this half hearted approach. Focusing on the US market is understandable given the size and concentration of wealth in this market. It is also the one consumer market US companies are most familiar with. However this tactic won't fly for very long anymore, not with South-Asian countries rapidly closing the gap in innovation. Other cultures have been trying their hand at the wealthy US market for years: cars, anime, entertainment products.
In many cases localization is still limited to a mere cover change. Entertainment products in particular are too complicated and expensive to have customized code. Many of the games developed in Japan do undergo a branding makeover before being released on Western markets.

In this case the change is neatly summarized by this quote from a <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/why-japanese-box-art-is-better/">Gamesradar reviewer</a>: "Being happy is sometimes rather pleasant really. Japanese developers understand this mysterious truth, but while they keep trying to export their eternally sunny characters to us, we just keep transforming them into gloomy, moody tough guys."

Another thankful example of localization is the American editing used to make a Japanese anime shows more recognizable for an American audience. These changes go from common edits like translation...

... to cultural changes. In this case the Japanese food item <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onigiri">Onigiri</a> is replaced by a food item that is more recognizable to a US audience.

As the quote from Gamesradar just showed, localization isn't always favorably looked  upon. In fact, localization can backfire; being dismissed as 'closedminded to other cultures' or being made fun of when poorly executed.

<em>British comedian <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3759199/">Martin Billany</a> made fun of this sign (translated from Japanese), by wondering if this building would also have a 'bathroom room'.</em>

 UX professionals walk a fine line between praising the diverse richness of local cultures and creating walled garden products. As the world becomes more connected, culture will become a far more fuzzy concept. Cultures of the worlds are not flower pots: concepts, products and words spill over as people meet. It might be more cost-effective to accept some of these differences than to force them all to some local cultural equivalent.
Being raised in Belgium, I was used of seeing foreign shows with subtitles. Only shows for very young children were dubbed. The majority of those shows were American, which weren't changed or edited to Belgian culture at all. We also watched British, French or German shows. We still enjoyed them, regardless of the fact that some elements were foreign to us.

<strong>Global standards and templates</strong>
I love the idea of global templates. It shows confidence by the brand and promotes recognizability.
Quesenbery & Szuc seem to suggest that global templates are to be decided solely by the company. They make no mention of any guidelines or templates proposed by other entities. The idea that every company should do that kind of research in-house seems ludicrous to me. Why waste money doing the work a dozen others have already done before you? Not only that but it creates brand-specific standards and mutual incompatible technologies which are bothersome to the user and wasteful in terms of resources.

It is at this point that I want to mention <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html">ISO, the international organization for standardization</a>. I could rant about the world's different conventions all day long. They are a pain for international travellers: incompatible power voltages, different time formats, different measurement systems, different radio frequencies, different keyboards and all the different languages your product has to support. Some of these will take time and effort to change or require major changes to infrastructure (like the development of a unified power voltage network). Others merely require folks to mentally open up and consider something new and different.

For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> describes the recommended standardized way to write time. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data are transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times. It is this standard that should be applied worldwide!

While some resistance is to be expected, the system has objective benefits not only to local users but also to your product. As travel becomes more common, different versions of your product will have to communicate with each other. In the nineties Microsoft Office products were known to crash when different language versions communicated with each other. This was a significant problem in Europe, where professionals regularly crossed borders to do presentations or business meetings. Learn from that mistake.

Similarly, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">International System of Units (SI)</a> (the modern version of the metric system) has been in use since 1960. Today it is the world's most widely used system of measurement. However within English-speaking countries, most notably the US, the adoption has not been universal. Government attempts to promote use of the metric system have been partly undone by the widespread availability of products that still rely on the older imperial units. Designing your product with imperial units will hurt your globalization efforts, and adds to a lingering cultural problem standing in the way of trade in general.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
I find it interesting that a piece entitled "Design for a global audience" advocates tweaking your product to the local culture as much as possible. This strikes me as a somewhat naive, shortsighted approach. In that case you're not designing for a 'global' audience, what you are doing is simply diversifying your market.
That doesn't mean I support the idea of just designing for your home market and shipping the product unchanged. What I believe is that 'global templates' truly have to be designed with a global population in mind. That population is increasingly mobile: travelling and interacting with international colleagues. The borders are coming down. We cannot continue with an outdated metaphor of cultures as flowerpots anymore. Designing for a global audience entails embracing differences, not hiding them. It is also an invitation to reflect on our own cultural practices: to come together and design global systems that are better then the ones before.

This makes for a unique and fascinating challenge to UX professionals. What an exciting time to live in!

<em>Edit: I was asked to attach what I consider my own theoretical 'cultural model' to designing for a global audience. A plethora of cultural models are commonly used in academic research (<a href="http://laofutze.wordpress.com/2009/08/28/303/">Hofstede's onion model</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6aeqXaXOSg">Hall's iceberg model</a>, <a href="http://agents2change.typepad.com/blog4/2011/12/examing-culture-2-is-hofstedes-view-of-culure-relevant.html">Hofstede's triangle model</a>, <a href="http://www.crossculture.com/services/negotiating-across-cultures/">Lewis' triangle model</a>, the list goes on). I'm not a big fan of these theoretical constructs. I think they add very little to our understanding of what will always be a multivariate environment. Every culture will have its own local factors that come into play. To be perfectly frank, I believe this time is far better spend being in the field planning your product.
I was happy to hear that I'm not the only researcher who is critical of the academic obsession with theoretical models. Two prominent academic members from computer science here on campus voiced that same concern today. The issue seems to be discipline related: tech versus social sciences. We had a lovely discussion on it. Still, since I'm being strongly pressured to publish one, here it is:</em>
