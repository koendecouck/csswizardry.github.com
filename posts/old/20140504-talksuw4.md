<a href="/_post_images/2014/04/UX-presentation.pdf"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4192" alt="Talks.UW slidedeck" src="/_post_images/2014/04/Talks.UW-slidedeck-300x224.png" width="300" height="224" /></a> This week I'm sharing with you the <a href="/_post_images/2014/04/UX-presentation.pdf">UX presentation</a> I put together on campus needs for talks.uw, my proposed platform that will unite talks all over the University of Washington.

I chose to share the slide deck rather than the full report in order to keep things digestible to a casual reader. I like the speed of slides over long reports. I'm also quite fond of UW's purple house style. It feels 'clean' to me as I put my designer's hat on.

<strong>Executive summary</strong>
<ul>
	<li>UW staff and students regularly give talks about their work and other activities.</li>
	<li>High familiarity with talks within their departments;</li>
	<li>Unfamiliar with talks outside their departments</li>
	<li>Communication about talks is mostly confined within departments (notice board, email).</li>
	<li>Information overload.</li>
</ul>
Many opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration remain untapped.
Talks.UW addresses this problem.

<strong>Show me their testimony.</strong>

<div><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I won't copy and dump all the research content in here. You can get all that from the <a href="/_post_images/2014/04/UX-presentation.pdf">slides</a>. Note though how I tried to integrate qualitative and quantitative perspectives in a way that is mutually enriching. In the last few studies I did, I was always wondering how to show participant testimonies in a way that shields the participant's identity at the same time. Most UX practitioners just show you a photo or video. I don't like that: to me showing the participant's face violates the anonymity you ensured as a researcher. What if someone in your audience knows and recognizes your participant?</div>
<div>I'm quite proud of the solution I devised for this study. I took inspiration from cinematography, showing you a physical location with an overlayed voice. You see it in movies all the time. This is the first time I tried it for a research presentation, and I think it works great!

<strong>Getting a representative sample.</strong>

<div><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">If you re-read my post from last week, you'll see that I shared some of the graphs already along with a few issues that popped up. One of the things I mentioned was the uneven distribution of participants across colleges.</span></div>
<a href="/_post_images/2014/04/2.png"><img class="alignleft" alt="2" src="/_post_images/2014/04/2-300x179.png" width="300" height="179" /></a> As you can tell the college of 'Arts &amp; Sciences' is making up for about half of my sample. Last week I talked about how that group might potentially bias my sample, but then again 'Arts &amp; Sciences' might genuinely have more students than the others colleges.

After making a few inquiries I was able to get my hands on this year's enrollment numbers. With those I can update the original graph to give you an impression of representativeness.

<a href="/_post_images/2014/04/fig2b1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4193" alt="fig2b" src="/_post_images/2014/04/fig2b1-300x170.png" width="300" height="170" /></a>

I divided the enrollment numbers by a fixed constant, to match the number of 'Arts &amp; sciences' in the sample. The red bars indicate the sample I would have expected to see given proportional college participation in the survey. I have a shortage of engineers and a surplus on environmental graduates. This may be a result of my standardized approach in contacting each of the departments. I send out the same survey request to everyone. After a few follow-up conversations with staff from the college of engineering, I realized  that they're much more wary of surveys and people bothering them (especially the computer science people, do they get more obnoxious adverts?). I could prod then a little to get that number up, but that gets me in murky water in terms of methodology. I think I'm rather happy with how the sample turned out.

<strong>So what happens now?</strong>

<strong></strong>This concludes my research part of the project. It's time to take of my researcher hat and put on my designer one! In the past week I've been busy doing paper prototypes with participants. More specifically, I'm doing <em>rapid iterative prototypes</em>, with <em>multiple parallel designs</em>. At the same time I've also started coding in Ruby, as I'll be talks.uw's developer at the same time.

This is quite an exciting learning opportunity. Being researcher, designer and developer all-in-one gives me a chance to grow and stretch myself. I don't get to be this all-round as much as I'd like. I love it!
