Like I noted in my last post, you may come across situations were hard data and a logical argument is not enough. If you want to promote your work, it helps to know a few tips and tricks about videos.

As a general rule, people react more strongly to visual stimuli. Good designs exploit that by adding well-chosen imagery to accompany the text (<a href="http://koendecouck.com/?p=4082">as noted in my last post</a>). The reason for that is evolutionary: we've evolved under conditions that prioritized vision (and to a lesser extend hearing) over other senses. Better to spot a bear from far away then having to rely on touch to find out. Similarly we respond more strongly to <em>moving</em> images than static ones (This notion is so basic, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022096566900671">it even applies to newborns</a>). The emotional response you'll get from video will always out-way photos.

To prepare for my project's promo campaign I remade this old FoneAstra video:

Into this one:

Compare the two videos for yourself (Note that they are both exactly 3.5 minutes). Which one do you find more appealing? Which one excites you more?

Some of the principles of why this works:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Relevance</strong>. Don't just tell me what it does, make me care about it.</li>
	<li><strong>Limited attention span</strong>. This is the MTV generation. Prioritize brief powerful shots over long ones to capture your audience's attention.</li>
	<li><strong>Music score</strong>. Go Hollywood and add a well-chosen music trail to your video. Be careful though as this can go horribly wrong if you select an inappropriate one. Make sure it's high-quality material so your audience doesn't get annoyed by it. If you have the necessary skills I recommend applying fade-in, fade-out and cuts to the music as well. In my video I made a few edits to the timing to make sure some crescendos in the music coincided with certain shots.</li>
	<li><strong>Social mimicry</strong>. Noticed that applause? I intentionally left that in for the some reason your favorite soap series has laugh tracks. As social creatures we feel pressured to share the emotional reactions around us.</li>
	<li><strong>Use different angles</strong>. I'm not cinematographer. I don't know why this work exactly, only that it does. Professional media use aerial drones to record top-down views. Movies have different angles to emphasize certain scenes.</li>
</ul>
And what to avoid.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Being your own actor.</strong> I'm very self-conscious, I know I don't have the swooning allure of Brad Pitt or Edward Cullen. I have neither the looks nor the acting talent for it. However good you think you are, don't figure in your own video unless you're professionally qualified to do that line of work. You also need to be gorgeous to look at. That's a rule of showbiz.</li>
	<li><strong>Being your own narrator.</strong> I'm a non-native English speaker and have a prominent Dutch accent that always gives it away. Accents are charming at first, but they get annoying fast. So I personally never narrate anything. You also need an interesting voice to do your narrating. Some people sound very monotonous, which would be your worst nightmare as a narrator. I'm no voice actor, so I generally try to avoid narration all together. Or I try to find a sexy voice to do my narration for me.</li>
</ul>
