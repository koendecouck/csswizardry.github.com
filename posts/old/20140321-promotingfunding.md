This post talks about <a title="FoneAstra" href="http://koendecouck.com/?portfolio=foneastra"><strong>FoneAstra</strong></a>, my HCDE capstone project.

Nobody really tells you this when you start a new project, and you might be to starry eyed to even consider it for the first few weeks. You have an awesome idea for a new product. Your idea is amazing, it's going to change the world as we know it. But how do you get it out there? You're going to need tools, materials, participant incentives. That means funding. Furthermore, you'd like people to hear about your idea so you start building out a team, followers or an early consumer base. And that's going to require some promoting...

<strong>The game is afoot</strong>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For the past two weeks I've been busy preparing support for my spring quarter FoneAstra redesign. As a master student, I don't get research grants or access to some hidden university research fund. Behold life in grad student </span>purgatory<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">: neither academia nor industry. My capstone </span>adviser<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> was helpful enough to point out that I was going to need some resources (oh really?), but he couldn't give me advice on how to get them. I don't think he knew either. </span>Therefore, unless I wanted to be stuck using duct tape and household materials, I figured I'd better get busy.

<strong>Funding</strong>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I typically picture this as zooming out on a map. In my experience local sources have the best chance of giving you at least something. The opportunities grow for each level, but the agencies get progressively harder to reach. They also take longer to get back to you and may require more paper work.</span>
<ul>
	<li>Department</li>
	<li>Faculty</li>
	<li>University</li>
	<li>City</li>
	<li>State</li>
	<li>National</li>
	<li>International</li>
	<li>Everyone</li>
</ul>
Right now I'm taking a shot at the <strong><em>Capstone Design Award</em></strong> and the <strong><em>TEDxFulbright social challenge</em></strong>. The first one is located on faculty-level at the College of Engineering. It's specifically designed to help students get some of the funds they need. Fun note: only undergraduate students are eligible. However its funding is provided by engineering alumni and professional investors, who probably don't care about the undergrad-grad distinction. So I'm applying anyway, there is nothing to be lost by trying.

The second option is on national level and quite exciting. My FoneAstra capstone project is currently a semi-finalist for the upcoming TED event in Washington DC. There is about a 50 percent chance of advancing to the finals and being invited to the TED stage, addressing the US Chamber of Commerce! The guaranteed funding that it will bring is limited, it's more about promoting and getting people's to listen. If only for a few minutes. I figure my best bet is to aim for crowdfunding channels (like <a href="http://www.rockethub.com">RocketHub</a> or <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a>). For those, funding and promoting go hand-in-hand.

<strong>All the world's a stage</strong>

<em>All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players</em>. Guess what, nobody cares about your project, unless you go on stage and tell them why they should. Promoting your work is an art form, one that seems poorly developed for many academics. Perhaps they should have done a masters, where it's <em>promote or die </em>rather than<em> publish or perish</em>.

Anyway what makes promoting an art is that some people can't be convinced by any data or argument alone. The sole thing that gets through to them is passion. You do that by finding your passion, get some attention, and then telling a good story. How does that apply to FoneAstra? So far there doesn't seem to have been much effort at all in telling a story. <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rohitc/foneastra.html">Here is the first Google hit on <em>FoneAstra</em>, also its main website anno 2014</a>:

<a href="/_post_images/2014/03/rohit.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4083" alt="rohit" src="/_post_images/2014/03/rohit.png" width="755" height="623" /></a>

Rohit is a PhD fellow at the department of Computer Science. The man is a genius. FoneAstra is his baby, but like most technical geniuses he is more concerned about the data then about how others perceive his work. You'll notice that the post is actually a portfolio piece and quite technical. It's generally unappealing to read. The only photos are of circuits and schematics. The black background feels gloomy and it doesn't really tell me why I should care.

Instead, here is the promotional image I made this week to support my give-the-poor-grad-some-funding efforts:

<a href="/_post_images/2014/03/Foneastra-2-logossmall.png"><img alt="Foneastra-2 logos(small)" src="/_post_images/2014/03/Foneastra-2-logossmall.png" width="864" height="560" /></a>

The image is light and cheery. Rather than showing the actual project, it focuses on the goal you'll be investing in. Thanks to you, that cute baby boy will get to grow up. This family will keep on smiling. It promotes maternal health and fights HIV, answering the UN world development goals for 2015. How can you not care about this?

Most importantly though, it prominently states NAME, PURPOSE and PARTNERS. Having a partners sticker always seems like a good idea to me, just in case one of them comes across your promo campaign. Being a master student is tricky: if you get too much funding or support for your project, the project's partners might feel bothered by it (in which case they could always hire me). I also made a so-called <em>madness slide</em> (meant for 60 second pitches) and a poster that showcases the product. Both are more technical, intended for different audiences.

This post is pretty long already so next I'll make a new post talking about promoting your work through video.
