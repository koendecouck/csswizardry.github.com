It looks as though your device is offline. Not to worry; I’ve prepared some
offline content for you to read whilst you wait for your connection to come
back:

* [head to the homepage](/);
* [read a little more about Koen De Couck](/about/);
* [learn about the services I offer](/services/);
* [see how I helped Medialaan set up an Hadoop architecture](/case-studies/medialaan-cloudera/), or;
* [find out how best to get in touch with me](/contact/).

Or if you’d like to read something:

* [MD Formatting Example](/2018-02-18-formattingexample/)
* [Why I type in Dvorak](/2014-08-07-dvorak/)

I’m next speaking at:
