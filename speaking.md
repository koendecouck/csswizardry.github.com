Having spoken at many public events, sharing my knowledge with
development and product teams is something I am both very experienced with and
hugely passionate about. If you’re running an event and would like me to speak, I
have prepared [some information for you](#section:request).

As well as speaking at development conferences, I can (and indeed do) speak at
private engagements for companies and their staff. If you are a company who
would like a tech talk to be delivered on-site to a private audience, please do
[get in touch](mailto:koen.decouck@outlook.com?subject=Internal%20Tech%20Talk).

If you feel like you’d like something a little more involved and in-depth, then
you’re probably looking for a workshop. I’ve run countless workshops for both
public events and private clients. Read [more about what that involves](/workshops/).

## Request to Speak

I would absolutely love to speak at your conference! However, I do just have a
few questions to make the whole process a lot simpler and upfront for everyone
involved. If you could [fire me an
email](mailto:koen.decouck@outlook.com?subject=Speaking%20Request)
answering as many of the below as possible, I’d be really grateful. If you don’t
have answers to everything just yet, please don’t worry—this is just a rough
starting point, not a test. Please also remember that **there is no right or
wrong answer** to any of these questions.

* **When and where is your conference?** I once [travelled 4,000
  miles](https://www.google.com/search?q=distance+brussels+to+sanjuan)
  to give a talk; I’m not afraid of a commute.
* **How many attendees do you expect to have?** Rough figures or previous sizes
  are perfectly fine.
* **What kind of audience do you have?** It helps to know what the audience will
  be like (e.g. mainly developers, mainly business users, etc.).
* **Which other speakers have you approached?** It helps to be aware of any
  other speakers who run the risk of delivering similar talks.
* **How long does the talk need to be?** Do you have a set talk duration? 45
  minutes is usually ideal.
* **Do you cover speaker expenses?** Flights, hotels, train journeys, etc.
* **What kind of talk would you like?** I usually give technical talks (Hadoop
  architecture, performance, etc.), but am open to discussing other topics.
* **Do you require a brand new talk?** Writing talks takes a lot of time and
  effort: forewarned is forearmed.
* **When can I start publicising your event?** Do you want to keep the lineup
  quiet for a while, or can I add your event to my speaking list immediately?
* **Do you plan to compensate speakers?** I usually charge a fee to speak,
  however its value is open to discussion for indie and non-profit events.

### What’s in It for You?

I will help to promote and publicise your event. I will endeavour to make myself
available to attendees for the entire duration of the event. I will attend all
social activities surrounding the event. I will deliver a quality talk of
practical relevance. I will gladly allow you to record and distribute my talk.
